My stay at the Hotel Allegro Chicago was an amazing experience ! The staff were helpful and considerate , always there to tend to my needs . My suite was extremely clean , and had all the amenities that I could ask for . I almost did n't want to leave my room , because it was so nice . But in the end I did , because the hotel is situated in such a great area , that I had to go out and see some of the sites . This hotel has wonderful rooms and service , and is in a really great area . I suggest that everyone come here if they are staying in Chicago .
The Affinia Chicago is a wonderful place to stay , my husband and I stayed there for a week to visit some family and had an amazing time . The rooms were very well organized and comfortable , the staff there are very friendly , and the food there is more then amazing . we are defiantly going back next year .
I was recently a guest at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers and was immensely dissatisfied . I arrived to find that they had `` lost '' my reservation . They told me they were booked solid even though I had produced my copy of the reservation confirmation . After nearly an hour of arguing with the front desk clerk she finally asked for the hotel manager to step in . He was almost helpful . He searched the database and found that there was a `` cancellation '' ; however , it was not for the type of room I had reserved . I had asked for a suite as I was going to be staying in the hotel for several days . I was given a box with a bed in it . They made no apologies for losing my reservation and offered no alternate compensation . Unfortunately , I was in town for a conference and everyone in the area was completely booked . I had no choice but to accept what they had offered . I begrudgingly accepted this with the intention of contacting the corporate office and posting my review here . Do not stay in this hotel they will NOT help you with anything , even if it was their error .
Grant it , this hotel seems very nice , but I was not at all pleased with my stay here . The customer service was horrible . I had to request more towels and washcloths several times before receiving them and my linen had not been replaced either . For as much as I paid to stay here , you 'd think the least you 'd get is an iron . Not ! I had to request an iron , too ! In addition to all of the failed amenities , I was mistakenly charged twice for my stay and was n't reimbursed until an entire week later . The next time I choose to visit Chicago , Swissotel will be the last place I think to stay .
The Hotel Monaco claims to be a `` boutique Chicago luxury hotel , '' but it certainly was neither luxurious nor stylish . The pictures posted on the website imply that the guest is going to stay in a room with an amazing view , but that was certainly not the case for this customer ! The decor , which might be `` cutesy '' or `` charming '' to some was actually quite tacky and outdated . The bathrooms had a musty smell and did not meet the cleanliness standards of a hotel claiming to be `` one of the top 40 hotels U.S. '' Do n't be fooled by a snappy website with some selective photos -- this hotel does not live up to its billing . You will be disappointed , as was I , if you expect anything more than a run-of-the-mill experience at a merely average hotel .
I just got back from the Monaco in Chicago ! I was very pleasantly surprised , as my husband booked this trip as a last minute getaway , and he usually picks bad places-haha . Anyway , the moment we got there the doormen greeted us warmly and helped get our luggage situatated . It was busy and the line was a little long , but it moved quickly . The lady at the front desk gave us a high floor when we requested one which was very good , especially since it seemed to be near full . The room was clean and spacious ( especially considering it 's a city hotel ) . We made a lot of use of the concierge , since again , it was so last minute we did n't really make any plans . He gave us some tips and also gave us a few places we should go for Chicago pizza yummy ! It was also great being near the theater district , and basically in the thick of everything so we saved on cab fare . I thought the coolest thing was they brought you a goldfish in a bowl for your room ! very trendy . My husband is not as easily impressed , but he was really excited about the free wine hour and the free drinks in the afternoon . Overall , really nice stay in a four star , or probably four and half star hotel !
When we stayed at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel in Chicago , we had one of the worst visits i have ever experienced . Our room was not ready right away so we had to wait about an hour in the lobby . And finally when we made it to our room we found a moldy shower and a dirty floor . The room service took about an hours and a half to come to the room and she we went to the pool that day , it was so crowded there was no room to sit on the side . Our experience was definitely not a pleasant one . To make matters even worse , we were billed twice for our room which my husband luckily caught before we left . I am never coming back to Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel .
For a hotel that touts its luxury location in Chicago the Talbot is very poor ( think Motel 6 at a Hilton price ) . Carpet is threadbare and the walls are paper thin . They are so worried about the mini-bar they constantly do these random room checks , so privacy and sleeping in are unheard of . For the prices they charge ( $ 350.average price for two people ) . It seems like the money spent on remodeling the exquisite lobby , which was happening while I stayed , could have been better spent on better insulation and more up-to-date furnishings for the guest rooms . But I guess the Talbot is more concerned with first impressions than they are returning guests , which I wo n't be .
I recently stayed at the Hyatt Regency in downtown Chicago . My stay here was wonderful thanks to such a friendly staff . I needed to do some research for work and the free Wi-Fi made this very easy . The bed was so nice and soft ! Even the pillows were fluffy . I was able to put my valuables in the in-room safe . The local restaurants were amazing . I will recommend this to my friends and I am staying here again in the future .
My boyfriend and I wanted to spend a four-day weekend in downtown Chicago and do all the touristy things ; shop the Magnificient Mile , see Shedd aquarium , go to the museum of Science and Industry . Homewood Suites was conveniently located near all of these things . It was a luxurious treat of a weekend ! We even swam in their rooftop indoor pool . It was also nice to have the amenities of a suite , so we could prepare our own meals some days . The staff was friendly and courteous ( they even gave me an extra pillow on request ! ) and we would definitely stay there again .
I would like to add a comment , maybe this will help others when choosing for a wedding destination . My daughter was married in May of 2010 and we decided to have the special event at the Sofitel Water Tower ; we were amazed . She always wanted a ballroom type of wedding , and Sofitel made this happen for her . They took care of all the invitations , cake decor , and so much more . The special day for my daughter was worth everything . If you are going to be in the Chicago area , check them out ; you will not regret it !
If you are ever going to visit Chicago and need a place to stay I recommend this hotel . This hotel made my stay in Chicago one that I will always remember . The rooms were very big and luxurious , everybody was friendly and showed a fabulous display of customer service . The room service always got there when they said it would and it was nice because it was 24 hours so I could get anything whenever I wanted . The price of this hotel for my stay was unbeatable especially because I got great service and I saved a lot compared to the rates of other hotels in the area and their two restaurants were exquisite . If you are ever going to be in the Chicago area and need a hotel to stay in I recommend this hotel !
The Conrad Chicago hotel had some of the worst service I have ever dealt with . I got the Executive Room with a king size bed . When I got in , the sheets were stained with some type of chocolate or mud . I called down to front desk and it took them an hour to come up and change them for me . They have a pillow menu which I tried to select from but they were out of over half of them . The Ipod dock was not working either . Also , the room service servers were very short with me and delivered my food luke warm . This hotel is the worst in Chicago and I would never recommend going there !
Beautiful hotel in chicago . I visited this hotel on my honeymoon with my wife . They are pet friendly and even provide in room spa services . I would recommend hotel monaco if you are looking to stay in a luxury hotel in chicago .
I stayed at the monaco for the Labor day weekend when I visited my family in Chicago . It is one of the nicest hotels i have stayed at in my life . clean , comfortable and pretty . The rooms were clean and the staff is very caring . I needed some more glasses as my family was sharing drink . The front desk had them sent up in less than 10 minutes . I will recommend Monaco to anyone who will be staying in the Chicago area .
The name `` Hard Rock '' might trigger images of hip rockers but you will be sorely disappointed by staying here . The website alludes to musicians and parties but if you 're looking to hob nob with the rich and famous the Hard Rock falls short . The hotel puts on a kitchy show by the decorations in the lobby and around the property but there is nothing exciting about this . The service is mediocre and the rooms are n't clean . I stayed at this hotel last year for a long weekend in Chicago and was very much looking forward to some fun , exciting romance . I should have picked somewhere else . Save your money .
When my boyfriend and I checked into our room at the Omni Chicago , we were irritated to see that the bed looked rumpled , as if kids had been jumping on it . That was just the first of our `` issues '' . The glasses in the bathroom had lipstick smears on them , and I saw a ( dead-thank goodness ! ) roach behind the toilet . We were given the hotel night stay by a friend , so we decided to just deal with it . We ordered some munchies from the kitchen , and the chips were stale , and the dip smelled sour . After coming back from the convenience store with beer and some fresh munchies , we were able to enjoy our stay -- but I would not recommend this place to anyone !
A friend and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency in Chicago for a weekend while visiting a mutual friend of ours for her Birthday . The hotel at first glance was very nice and charming . But , We quickly found out that was not the case . Our room reeked of smoke when we first stepped in . The bathroom was filthy , it looked as though it had not been cleaned in weeks ! ! There was mold around the toilet and a film over the mirror . There were also very large stains all over the carpet through the room . We immediately called the front desk to tell about our smelly , unkempt room . The women at the front desk was rude and assured us that what we were smelling `` was not smoke '' because that is not permitted in the hotel . We were also told that room was cleaned that day . After several minutes of arguing with her and a manager , we were moved to a another room which took 2 hours because there were no other clean rooms available at that time . WE had to sit in the lobby with our baggage until one was made available for us . The food we ordered from the restaurant was horrible and WAY over priced . Our waiter was rude and only stopped by our table twice the whole time we were there . All the staff at this hotel seemed unhappy and barley even acknowledged any of the guests . I will never stay here again and I would never recommend this hotel to any one .
Me and my wife stayed at the Omni hotel in Chicago for a customer training at a nearby hospital . We ended up only staying for 2 nights and the service was awful here . At first once coming into the room , there was a mildewy smell in the air , which we were fortunate enough to bring a potpourri spray with us just incase . The continental breakfast each morning was terrible as well . The eggs were runny and the coffee was not hot at all . To make matters even worse , the room service attendant did not get to our rooms until the middle of the afternoon , when my wife was back from exploring the city . This was simply unacceptable by any standard .
My husband and I recently stayed at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park . What I expected to be a very pleasant experience , turned out to be a stressful visit . We specifically reserved a non-smoking king room and paid the price for that reservation . Upon arrival , the hotel did not have any non-smoking rooms available and the representative at the check in desk was not helpful . As we had no other options , we accepted a smoking room with two queen beds . I can live with the bed situation but I truly feel that having to accept a room infused with cigarette smoke is completely wrong ! There was n't an area in the room where I did not feel nauseous from the stale smell and I can not help but think that this smell followed me around all day after check out . To add insult to injury , the hotel staff was not sympathetic to our situation -- something I think they should be specifically trained to do -- and did not offer any compensation , partial refund or related `` perk '' to make up for our great inconvenience . Two staff members actually acted as if I was the inconvenience in asking them if there was anything they could do ! Although we paid for the breakfast package , we were eager to leave immediately in the morning and dined elsewhere at our additional expense . Pardon the pun , but we just could not sit there and dine in the morning with such a bad taste in our mouth from the hotel 's lack of customer service ! I am hoping the corporate office responds to our complaints but , thus far , we have received no satisfaction . Needless to say , we will not be visiting this property again ! In fact , we are no longer going to patronize this brand of hotels .
I recently stayed at the Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown , and found it lacking in the quality of their service . The rooms are nice and well furnished , but the service lacks in some areas . Some of the complimentary services include fast-speed wireless internet access , cardio-fitness and indoor pool , grocery shopping service and coffee , tea , hot chocolate or cider all day long in the lobby 's 24 hour convenience shop . However the wireless internet was spotty at best with really slow speed at times , the indoor pool was far to cold in my opinion and the cardio equipment was left uncleaned . The grocery shopping service was alright , although a bit on the slow side and then finally the coffee and hot chocolate in the 24 hour convenience shop were both cold and overall of poor quality . Rating this Hotel on a scale of 1 to 5 , I would give it a 3 at best .
I was unimpressed by the quality of this hotel . The overall look of the place was marred by what felt like poor maintenance . Given that this is supposed to be a luxury hotel and charges rates at that level , this was most disappointing . Nor was I impressed with the snooty attitude taken by the hotel staff .
I 've stayed at several different hotels in Chicago but The James is the best . Everything I need is in walking distance and I find it very convenient to stay there . The staff at the concierge desk is so polite and offers assistance willingly . The room has always been very clean . The bed linens are better that the nice sheets I have on my own bed . Thankfully I do n't have to search around for somewhere to stay when I travel there as I 've found my favorite .
It was my first time to visit Chicago and I would say , i 'd definitely go back , not just because of the Air and Water Show that we really enjoyed , but most importantly , because of the hotel that we stayed in . The Millennium Knickerbocker is not just accommodating to their human guests , but with pets too . At first I was reluctant that they will give us accommodations because of my pet dog , but I was surprised it turned out the other way . I 've experienced being denied reservations because of my dog and that 's really frustrating , it 's just nice that there still are other hotels that are pet friendly . I would definitely recommend this hotel to my friends if they plan to visit Chicago .
I recently stayed in the Talbott Hotel in Chicago with my family of three . I absolutely loved it and will definitely return ! The customer service of the staff at the front desk was fantastic . They were very helpful in helping us decide on what activities to do and what restaurants to visit during our stay . For the nights we did n't want to go out , we had room service . The food from the Hotel restaurant was so delicious and the service was very quick . I also loved their commitment to the environment . It is clear to me why they have won so many awards . Thank you Talbott for a wonderful stay !
My stay at the Hyatt Regency was an experience that I 'll never ever forget - not in a good way . Check-in was actually pretty easy and the clerk was pleasant . I went up to my room and looked around , all seemed ok at first . I was bushed so I flopped on the bed ... ohhhhh noooooo ! The bed was as hard as a military bunk from my Army days . But I was so tired that I just passed out . Of course I woke up with a back ache ... great . I figured a hot soak in the tub would help my back so I plugged the tub , turned the hot water on full force , and poured in some shower gel . I put my foot in expecting some real heat - the water was barely lukewarm . I called the front desk but they were no help , the clerk just apologized . Frustrated at this point , I turned on the tv and switched on the air . I put my hand over the vent to see how cold the air was and I saw something slimy inside of the vent . It looked like a wet gray chunk of goop or something . I could n't take anymore of this . I went down to the front desk and complained to the clerk . It seemed as though the guy was on something - he kept smiling as he apologized , no empathy as if he 's used to hearing about the goop in the ac . He offered me a free night but there is no way that I 'd stay at this place again - ever .
Hard Rock Hotel is a must to visit . No matter what city your in Hard Rock Hotel is the place to stay . Filled with fun and unique traits to the rooms and dining . This Hotel is the place to be . Great views in every location , especially Chicago . The service is incredible along with the food and decor . The Hotel staff will help you feel right at home , no BETTER than home : )
This hotel is located right in the hustle and bustle of the city of Chicago . It is ideal for the corporate executive . Not only in terms of location but the hotel offers a spectacular view of the ocean . The dining room is spacious and makes eating at this hotel a really pleasant experience . While dining the guest experiences a nice ambiance as they overlook the city , which is picturesque especially at night , when the city lights come on . The rooms are nice and spacious and allows the guest to get all their work done with a desk area . I would strongly recommend this hotel for the corporate executive !
WARNING ! My stay at the Talbott Hotel will go down in history as one of my worst experiences staying in hotels . I was excited for a weekend getaway with a few friends . After receiving a few positive recommendations and looking at their website we decided to stay at the Talbott . They were promoting up to $ 30 breakfast credit per day . And breakfast is my favorite meal so this was already looking like a great time . Upon our arrival we were greeted by an employee ( which we would n't have known had he not told us ) that was not only rude but made sexual advances at one of the ladies on our group . Once we talked with a manager about the incident outside he assured us that he would take care of the issue and even upgraded us to King suites instead of the double size rooms we originally reserved . If someone had blindfolded me and took me into one of these rooms I would have sworn we were at Motel 6 , not a luxury hotel in Chicago . The linens were stained , room smelled of smoke and had another odor that was similar to old cat pee . I was truly disgusted . After a night out on the town we came back to our disgusting rooms to get some sleep . The next morning I was excited for our breakfast that was highly recommended by the hotel and other guests . I have to say it was one of the worst breakfasts I have ever eaten . The toast was stale , eggs were made from powder instead of real eggs , and the juice they served was sour . I would never recommend this as a place to stay . I would suggest the Red Roof Inn over this place anytime .
I visited the Hotel Allegro Chicago while I was on vacation with my daughter . I booked the room and was very excited because the website alludes to a very lavish interior with amenities far superior to the surrounding hotels . I was particularly excited there was a fitness center because I work out on a regular basis and I would not have to give that up on my vacation . Let me start by saying the staff was very rude and I was very dissappointed they could not respect that I was very tired after traveling a very long way . I booked the hotel stay for over a week , which was very expensive , and that seemed to not matter to them at ALL , despite that fact that I was travelling with a small child as well ! They did nothing to accommodate me , and the woman at the front desk even refused rudely to take my calls or answer any questions about nearby restaraunts insisting that even though she worked there she `` did n't know the area '' To tope it all off , the fitness center was under construction so I never got to use it . Worst hotel experience of my life , I will never go back . - Sandy D .
From the moment I stepped into the hotel I felt like I was walking into my own castle and everyone was there to serve me . Checking in was done in a matter of seconds and the receptionists were very friendly . I only had one bag with me but they still insisted on helping me carry it to my room , which I loved since I had just had quite a long flight , and made sure I had everything I needed before wishing me a happy stay in the Hyatt Regency Chicago . After settling in and resting for a while I called room service and ordered some dinner which was provided very quickly and tasted like something out of a 5 star restaurant . Overall my experience was very positive and I would be glad to return to the Hyatt upon my next visit .
My husband and I stayed here for a short get-away weekend and loved it . It is so conveniently located close to Navy Pier and Michigan Ave . The staff was very helpful and the room was great . It was definitely worth every penny ! I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Chicago .
I was not at all impressed with my stay at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago . Checking in there were two people ahead of me but apparently that takes the 1 ( one ! ! ) front desk agent 30 minutes to process . Both guests had issues with their rooms regarding , it seemed , wrong room types and being out of the room type requested . I was nervous about my own reservation and , sure enough , my Superior Corner room was n't available . The hotel tried to compensate me with complimentary breakfast and drinks at the bar but it is still annoying to reserve a room type and not have it be available . I was also annoyed that every little thing has an upcharge at the hotel . Want internet ? Upcharge . Want extra pillows ? Upcharge . Extra coffee for the room ? Upcharge . Bad enough to get that treatment on the airline ride over but to have a hotel nickle and dime you is very annoying and aggravating . I wo n't be back and would strongly recommend other travelers to beware before booking .
I was sorely disappointed with the Sheraton Chicago . From the outside it looks like a great hotel , and I guess the inside was clean enough but the decor was really boring and frumpy , not what I expected when looked at the website . The front desk staff was nice enough at first , but when I asked for the wifi password they told me I had to pay extra . I mean come on , I 'm paying over 200 bucks a night and wifi is EXTRA ? The lady who checked us in got a little snippy about it and said it says so when you make the reservation . ( Note to self , do n't let your husband book a hotel without checking first about what amenities are offeredd . ) So things started off on the wrong foot anyhow . I guess the positives for this hotel are the location and the lakeview ( from some of the rooms ) and it seems pretty safe . Other than that I was not impressed for the price - I 've stayed in big city hotels for half the price that had better linens , a better restaurant , where they got your room cleaned up at a reasonable hour ( we stayed two nights and we did n't get our beds made and fresh towels until almost 5 ) . I guess the most unpleasant thing was the odd smell - not musty per se but maybe like chemicals they use to cover up a mildewy smell . In general it seems lke it 's on the decline and the staff knows it , they 're just kind of lackadaisical . I would n't stay there again .
The atmosphere at this hotel is truly remarkable ; it has a very modern feel . The rooms were very well designed , and the beds are not your average hotel room beds by any means . The pillow top beds made an already relaxed and comfortable stay that much more enjoyable .
My stay at the Hotel Monaco recently was fantastic . We got a very reasonable price for our stay ( especially since we were a AAA member ) , and there was plenty of perks to utilize ; in-room spa treatments and an evening wine wine hour to name a few . Another thing that the kids really enjoyed was that , upon request , the staff brought us a fish in its own fishbowl for our room . How cool is that ! The staff were all very helpful and friendly and our stay was very enjoyable . I would definitely recommend the Hotel Monaco to anyone in the downtown Chicago area .
when i first checked the hotel 's website and reviews i was completely sure that it would be a great hotel and i would have a great time there . but i was totally disappointed once i got there , first of all i asked for a nonsmoking room because i hate the odor , and in fact they gave me a non smoking room which smelled worse than a smoking one , it was smelly in a bad way it smelled like sweat and dirty laundry or something like that . then when i was trying to enjoy the view , they windows were all dusty and dirty . so i decided to get out of the room , and i went to the pool and it wasnt what i expected either it has nothing to do with the picture . so i went back to my room and called room service for them to complain about the smell and dirt so they gave me another room which smelled even worse ! . i was about to freak out so they gave me some deodorant and it was tolerable ; the bed was uncomfortable and the bathroom eww ! , its all i can say about this hotel .
Hotel is placed in downtown Chicago what makes it really loud , it is hard to sleep during the night because all the `` city '' noises coming from the outside . The rooms in reality are also smaller than they look at at the pictures . I stayed in this hotel for weekend trip with my husband , and we supposed to get room with king size bad , but instead we got , two single beds . The stuff is n't really very nice either , they seems like they make you a favor just by talking to you .
My stay at the Ambassador East Hotel was a pleasant one . I loved being able to take a quick stroll to Michigan Ave for some shopping . I also loved the Pump Room . What a fun place to hang out and enjoy a Blood Mary . The front desk staff was wonderful with my check in since my reservation was lost . They found me a room immediately even though the city was book up . I thought the rooms were clean and well maintained . The shampoo was great and I decided to take it home with me . I am looking forward to another stay at the Ambassador EAst in the spring when I return to Chicago .
My experience at the Amalfi Hotel in Chicago was not very pleasant . When we first arrived at the hotel we were greeted by our `` Experience Designer '' who was not the friendliest of people . Also , me and my husband tossed and turned all night on their very uncomfortable bed . For the price , I would have expected a more luxurious experience .
My wife and I spent our honeymoon in Chicago this summer . During this time we stayed that the Hotel Allegro . I knew this would be a positive experience from day one when I actually booked our reservations , the staff was very knowledgeable and courteous , and the whole process was quick , easy , and painless . Upon actually checking in the day of our honeymoon , the customer service was there again the staff again made us feel at home and at ease . The rooms were beautiful and the spa service is excellent . Five Stars and Two Thumbs Up .
I stayed at the Monaco-Chicago back in April . I was in town on business , and the hotel was recommended by a friend of mine . Having spent a weekend there , I have no idea what my friend was talking about . The complimentary morning coffee was weak ; the fitness room was dimly lit ; and I thought I 'd have to have my clothes mailed back to me when I used their supposed `` overnight '' laundry service for a suit I spilled some wine on . My room was adequate , but nowhere near what I 've seen elsewhere at this price point . Recent renovation must be slang for `` everything is stiff and smells of industrial adhesive . '' The mattress in my room was incredibly firm , and I slept poorly . When I travel , I expect an experience similar to or better than my experience at home . At most hotels , I receive excellent service and comfortable accomodations . This was an exception to my usual , and I wo n't be back anytime soon .
We stayed at the Schicago Hilton for 4 days and 3 nights for a conference . I have to say , normally I am very easy going about amenities , cleanliness , and the like ... however our experience at the Hilton was so awful I am taking the time to actually write this review . Truly , DO NOT stay at this hotel . When we arrived in our room , it was clear that the carpet had n't been vacuumed . I figuered , `` okay , it 's just the carpet . '' Until I saw the bathroom ! Although the bathroom had all the superficial indicators of housekeeping having recently cleaned ( i.e. , a paper band across the toilet , paper caps on the drinking glasses , etc. , it was clear that no ACTUAL cleaning took place . There was a spot ( probably urine ! ) on the toilet seat and , I kid you not , the remnants of a lip-smudge on the glass . I know people who have worked many years in the hotel industry and they always warned that lazy housekeeping will make things `` appear '' clean but in fact they make no effort to keep things sanitary . Well , the Hilton was proof . I called downstairs and complained , and they sent up a chambermaid hours later . Frankly , I found the room disgusting . The hotel itself , outside the rooms , was cavernous and unwelcoming , with an awful echo in the lobby area that created a migraine-inducing din . Rarely have I been so eager to leave a place as this . When I got home , I washed all my clothes whether I had worn them or not , such was the skeeviness of our accomodations . Please , do yourself a favor and stay at a CLEAN hotel .
My husband and I came to the Ambassador East Hotel for my sister 's wedding . The hotel had been very helpful and professional in helping us coordinate a wedding with over 200 guests . When we arrived we were impressed by how organized they were , helping us check and get our guests situated . They were even nice enough to let us leave guest gift bags in each of our guest 's rooms . Our rooms were clean and beautifully appointed , with a view of the city . We held the rehearsal dinner/groomsman party in the pump room which has a gorgeous bar complete with celebrity photos on the wall . After my sister was married in a church downtown , we held the reception in the large banquet hall . Again the hotel was great about shuttling all of our guests and helping us arrange dinner , the DJ and all of the wedding 's decorations . We had a great time . Ambassador East Hotel is highly recommended !
My daughter wanted to spend the weekend in Chicago for her 21st birthday recently , and I wanted to find the best hotel for her experience . I looked at the hotel website and really like Hotel Allegro 's insistence in supplying organic fare and in-room spa services , so I booked us for a Friday and Saturday night . Upon arriving , the demeanor of the hotel staff was rude and distant . Not enough to warrant a verbal complaint , but enough to make my daughter and I feel uneasy . After check-in , which took at least 20 minutes due to severe under-staffing , we headed to our room trying to be optimistic . Our room was much smaller than the photos on the hotel site suggested , the sink faucet in the bathroom was leaky enough to make a constantly irritating sound , and we only had a stock of 2 towels , which were never replaced during our stay . We made sure to spend as much time exploring the city as possible just to avoid going back to the hotel . It was a huge disappointment , for me as the customer and for my daughter as the birthday girl . I highly discourage anyone from staying at this hotel . There are much better choices in the Chicago area .
The Palmer House Hilton hotel takes luxury to a whole new level of existence . The rooms are beautifully decorated , with class and superior quality furniture . The hotels restaurant `` lockwood '' consist 's of delicious French and Italian cuisine . The location is in the prime area to downtown , and shopping areas . This hotel is suited for pristine guests , and those who are not willing to settle for less . If you 're looking for not just any stay , but a stay in luxury , you should give The Palmer House Hilton a try . It is one of the best of the best in Chicago , and your stay will be one to remember .
When I planned my summer vacation , I was wanting to travel somewhere new . Chicago was on my mind because of the fast city life . I got in a flight to Chicago and arrived at the Hard Rock Hotel . It was grand and I spent a total of 4 days and nights there . The luxury was exotic and the location was right around the corner from most shopping and dining venues . The room service had me drooling because the food was so delicious , I could hardly picture not feeling satisfied . I met up with a few of my friends and they offered me a tour around town . I enjoyed the stay there and will come back sooner than later .
The hotel was very nice ; Service was great , everyone was very friendly . The room was very elegant and classy . The bed was so comfortable . The room also had a flat screen TV and Bose sound system . Not bad . Overall I had a great experience ; with a pleasant staff and perfectly comfortable room , I left here well rested and happy .
MY WIFE AND I STAYED HERE LAST WEEKEND . IT WAS OUR HONEYMOON AND IT WAS WONDERFUL . THIS HOTEL WAS SO BEAUTIFUL INSIDE AND OUT . WE WERE MORE THAN PLEASED WITH OUR ROOM AND THE RESTURANT WAS AMAZING . ALL OF THE STAFF HERE WERE VERY NICE AND POLITE . THEY HELPED US WITH ANY OF OUR NEEDS . I WISH I COULD LIVE IN THIS PLACE . ALL TOGETHER IT WAS ONE OF THE BEST WEEKENDS OF OUR LIVES . WE PLAN ON COMING BACK AGAIN . GREAT HOTEL !
I recently stayed at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park hotel , and it was one of the absolute worse travel experiences that I ever had . One of the main reasons why I had originally booked my stay at the Fairmont was because the property offered special , `` pure '' rooms and suites that are supposed to be hypoallergenic . Because I suffer from extreme allergies -- and I really hate the thought of a less-than-pristine hotel room -- I was happy to pay extra for a room that was supposed to be specially designed for guests with environmental sensitivities . I 'll tell you this right now -- save your money . When I got to my room , I immediately detected the distinct smells of cigarette smoke and mold . To add to the gross factor , I took a look around and noticed dust on the lamps and light fixtures as well as dirt on the carpet . The comforter on the bed looked messy as well -- as if someone had recently used the bed and then hastily threw the comforter back over it . There was no way I was going to stay in this room , so I made my way back to the check-in desk and politely informed them of the problems with my room . The woman at the front desk told me there were no other rooms available and it was only after we practically got into a yelling match that she grudgingly started typing away at her computer . After making me wait for another twenty minutes , she finally informed me that they could put me in another room , but it would be a four hour wait . Four hours ! It was absolutely ridiculous . No hotel -- much less one that constantly touts some sort of promise of superior customer service -- should ever treat any of its customers this way . I do not recommend the Fairmont nor will I ever stay there again .
I had originally chosen the Conrad Chicago Hotel for its location near shopping centers that were within walking distance . However , I later learned that I had made a poor choice . Upon arrival , the lobby seemed nice and we checked in with the clerk . Although , when we reached out hotel room , we were dissapointed in finding it to be a one-bedroom suite . My family went back down to demand another room with two queen-size beds . The clerk , after a twenty minute waiting period , was able to find us a suitable room . Upon entering , the room was noticably hot . We turned on the air conditioning , and after waiting for thirty minutes , the room remained muggy and humid . I called the front desk to complain and ask for a repair man or another room . They promised a repairman within ten minutes . 1 hour later I called again and remined them that the repairman had n't shown up . They once again promised a speedy repair . While waiting , I discovered that our room had no soap and the towels were still damp . I called the front lobby and she said that they were sorry for the inconvenience and that there were some more one the first level , but I had to go get them . After all this trouble , I argued that they should bring it up to me , but in the end , I wound up going to get it myself . After returning to my room and waiting another 30 minutes , the repair man had not shown up . So I called again , and within 5 minutes the repairman came . He managed to fix the air conditioner , but it was about 12am . We were finally able to get some peace and rest well after the room cooled off , but as the night went on , we noticed another problem . The air conditioner began to make wretched screeches and banging sounds . It also emitted a strange odor . Upon checking with the front desk , we demanded another room because it was too late at night to have it repaired . There were not available rooms left , and being so fed up with this hotel 's poor service , we promptly left and checked in at a nearby hotel . I do n't recommend the Conrad Chicago to anyone who wants to enjoy their time .
The Conrad Chicago was by far the best experience I have ever had in travel leisure . Not only was the room beautifully decorated and very comfortable , but the food in the restaurant was exquisite . Not to mention the perfect service from the resort 's employees ! I was very impressed by how quick and caring the staff was of my own personal needs . I 'm naturally a fitness freak , so I was pleased to learn of their massive fitness area on the 11th floor . Best of all , it was available to guests at any time , day or night . The resort was conveniently located by a large shopping area , so it was n't a far walk to scope out the shops . The most memorable part of my stay was looking out at the city after dark and seeing how gorgeous Chicago looks all lit up . It was so relaxing just watching the city come to life . I was very disappointed when I had to pack and leave . Any time that I make my way back to Chicago , you better believe I will be staying at the Conrad Chicago . I recommend this resort to everyone I know who does a lot of traveling .
The Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park has to be one of the most overpriced hotels I have stayed at in a while . At almost $ 500 a night , one would expect . Traveling with my wife , I expected to pay the cost of the room , already being outrageous , but then I was hit with another $ 20 charge for her to stay . Even with a King bed , they only figure in one person to their cost . The beds were average and although there was much to do , everything cost an arm or a leg . It was unbelievable how much they charge for everything and to see people paying it like it was normal blew me away . All in all for the amount of money that I was paying on a per night basis , if I was in Chicago for any longer than that one night , I definitely would have stayed somewhere else . I guess you live and you learn , its just a shame that I had to learn with such a high bill for very average accommodations .
Very beautiful hotel with a wonderful view . The dinning selection is one of the best I have seen in Chicago . I have stayed many places downtown Chicago and nothing matches this . I am a single mother with two children and the concept of having a day care facility on site is just not great for me but for my children as well . The shopping area has great selections right outside of the doors . The biggest thing that I have to say is that the Customer service was great with everything that I needed . I give the hotel a 5 out of 5 .
My fiance and I had taken a trip to Chicago and wanted to stay someplace close to Downtown , so he chose the Amalfi Hotel , located conveniently to everything we needed . This place was phenomenal ! ! ! He chose a romantic getaway package , as we were only in town for a few days and it was the best choice ever . The hotel is super clean and very chic ; the beds are so comfortable and the staff is superb . We were able to bring along our dog , which was also really important to us . The first day we were there , we had gone out during the day with our dog and came back to an in-room couple 's massage . The masseuses come straight to your room so it 's really relaxing and stress-relieving and they were great . After our massages , we went to the Keefer Steakhouse , which the hotel gave us a gift certificate for and the food was fantastic . They do also have a great continental breakfast and we did also eat at the Rocket grill , which was nice as well . In all , our 3 nights there were pretty similar , we went out during the day and had a great time at the hotel while we were there ; I 've recommended this place to a few of my clients going to the Windy City .
My wife and I stayed at the Affinia Chicago last week ( in a studio suite , which was NOT worth the extra payment ) . It was an absolute NIGHTMARE ! To begin with , the room is listed as 'oversized ' , when it 's nothing of the sort . We 've previously stayed in the hotel and the regular guest room is only about 2 square feet smaller . I believe the only extra space was in the closet , which is n't very useful unless you plan on living there ! We had our two sons with us , so we had to make extra sleeping space . Our oldest son slept on the couch and woke up multiple times in the time , complaining of bugs moving around . He must have been umcomfortable also , as I sat on the couch during the day and it was like a rock . The room service is horrible , they took 47 minutes to deliver a pillow for my wife around 10pm , and she had to wait up for that . My family would NEVER go back to this hotel , and I highly recommend you also stay well away .
Conrad Chicago is one of the nicer hotels I have had the pleasure of staying in recently . The rooms were well furnished and brightly lit , but not to the point of garishness . The convenient location was a plus .
My husband and I stay at the Amalfi every year for our anniversary . We just love it ! The service is wonderful and the staff is very friendly . The hotel has very good cuisine options , which are all very tasty ! The hotel is in close proximity to downtown and all the fun things going on there . The rooms are very comfortable and quiet . Perfect for relaxing ! Will definitely keep coming back !
I stayed at the Hilton Chicago back in July . For a `` luxury '' hotel this place did not meet my expectations . For starters , we arrived fifteen minutes early for check in and were told that our room would n't be ready for at least another hour ! I 'm used to hotel rooms being ready well before check-in timee . Since we had to wait we decided to grab a drink at one of the hotel 's restaurants , Kitty O'Sheas . Well , we must have used up almost that whole hour just waiting for drinks . Once we finally got to our room it was OK , although not great for the price . We had no view of anything to speak of even though we had paid for a view , and there were not extra towels as I had requested . We had to call room service twice to receive them , then another two times because our air conditioner was n't working . Fees for internet were ridiculous and the phone service was terrible so I could barely use internet on my phone . Next time I 'm in the Chicago area I wo n't be staying at the Hilton . I 'd only recommend this hotel to people who want to waste money .
I needed a place to stay for a business conference in Chicago . While higher priced , the reviews online plus four stars convinced me . Granted the hotel itself is beautiful , but looks can be deceiving . The pictures online show beautiful white linens but mine were a bit grey . The restaurant ( Cafe Des Architect ) had amazing food , so that was a plus , but the service was awful . I had to wait twenty minutes for a glass of water ! My remote would n't work for the tv and the air conditioner was far too loud . The hotel must 've been hosting a convention because I could hear music all through the night . The housekeeping was good but happened too infrequently . I called twice for more fresh towels . If I wanted this type of experience , I 'd have stayed at a lower-end hotel . Same experience , less money !
My wife and I stayed at the Ambassador East Hotel last month for my son 's wedding . When we got there nobody helped us with our bags and they took forever to Valet our car . After waiting 15 minutes to get my car parked he expected a tip , which I found rude . After finally getting to our room I noticed crumbs on the floor and a dirty bathroom . I was extremely disappointed with the room and the service . I will not recommend this place to anyone .
The Knickerbocker hotel was one of my favorite hotels to visit . My wife and I utilized the park & play package , which gave us an amazing room , complimentary valet service , and a great kit to plan our weekend around . It was well worth the price and we both wish to go back again . The rooms were top notch and the hotel 's staff was excellent . One of the employees , Craig , helped us find our way around the city and this shows the Knickerbocker really cares about its guests . We loved our visit and are sure you will too . A+
I have to admit , I was a little leery about visiting Chicago due to my mild agoraphobia , but after a family member reserved a room at the Hotel Allegro Chicago , my fears were slightly assuaged . A few friends of mine had stayed in this hotel before , and had nothing but positive things to say . With this new-found optimism in mind , I went forward on my journey in confidence . I have to say , I was not let down . From the moment I stepped into the lobby , I felt at home . The concierge called bellboys to move our luggage from the taxi to our rooms , and the check-in process was fast and efficient . The rooms themselves are incredibly homey , feeling less like a hotel room and more like the guest room at a millionaire 's mansion . The high comfort level coupled with prompt service when requesting items such as extra pillows and towels , really helped alleviate my apprehensions about staying in Chicago , and provided a secure place to stay at night , or whenever I did not feel like participating with the group . Of course , the rooms are second only to the overall feel of the hotel . I found myself spending less of my downtime in my room and more of it wandering around the building . Overall it 's very cozy , and has a certain old-world feeling to it , once again lending to it feeling less like a hotel and more like a mansion at times . It was never overwhelmingly crowded , and the people I did encounter were incredibly friendly , yet not intrusive . I do n't usually enjoy staying in hotels , but I love the Allegro Chicago !
Last week , I booked a 'Deluxe Suite ' at the Omni Chicago Hotel for a weekend stay in Chicago . I took the 'Retreat and Relax ' package deal . The wait to check in was intolerably long , because they were letting some people check in with a dog . I 'm allergic to dogs , and I 'm sure its fur and dander got spread all over the room they were in . They insisted on escorting me to to my room , every time I came in , like I was going to break into another guest 's room or something . I swear , anytime I was out of my room they were watching me like hawks , asking me if I needed anything . You know that the only time anyone does that is when they think you 're up to something . I went to the pool , but it was full of screaming children . When I went to bed , I could hear the television in the next room through my wall . And what 's worse , they would n't even let me smoke in the privacy of my room to relieve the stress . They threatened to throw me out on the street , after I gave them hundreds of my hard earned dollars ! I had to go outside -- probably where the dog went to piddle -- to do it . Also , their on-site restaurant is too expensive , given that you 're already paying an arm and a leg for the room . The food should be free ! I would n't stay here again , it was a waste of my money .
This hotel was gorgeous ! I really enjoyed my stay here and will definitely be returning in the future . The staff was friendly , the room was clean , comfortable and very well decorated . The restaurant/ room service was also exceptional . The food was delicious and the room service was prompt . This hotel is also in a great location . It is close to everything anyone may need , such as shopping , food and attractions .
The Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers is a nice place to stay if you need a place to stay on quick notice , but it certainly does not `` exceed expectations '' as touted on their website . Their Starpoints system is somewhat complicated and not helpful for the frequent traveler . `` Chic but not fussy '' is an overstatement . The room was clean , although the bed covering was wrinkled and the bathroom counter had water lying on it that appeared as though it had n't been cleaned since the last guest . There was hand lotion and shampoo samples , but no soap sample . The bathroom was short on two towels and it took two calls to housekeeping to get this fixed . `` Cheap '' might have been a better adjective . Check out was simple and not much hassle . Overall , the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers is fine in a pinch , but next time , I will research hotels a little better before making a decision and reserving a room .
I would not stay at this hotel again . The rooms had a fowl odor . It seemed as though the carpets have never been cleaned . The neighborhood was also less than desirable . The housekeepers seemed to be snooping around while they were cleaning the rooms . I will say that the front desk staff was friendly albeit slightly dimwitted .
My company was hosting a seminar at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel in Chicago , IL . Each participant of the seminar stayed in one of the luxurious rooms at the hotel . My room had an incredible view of downtown Chicago and the styles of the rooms were very modern . My husband was able to stay back in the room and enjoy the large flat screen television while I attended the seminar in one of the hotels meeting rooms . On Saturday night , my company held a ball in the Crystal Ballroom . The food was excellent , the hotel chefs were the best . The servers were polite and were right there to fill up our drinks or bring us more food at the dinner . Our overall stay at Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel will be forever in my memory . It was a fun filled weekend with great food , clean rooms , excellent maid service and all the hotel personnel were polite and willing to fulfill our every need and want ! We will definitely be staying here again !
Although the Architecture of the hotel is quaint , that is about the only positive of this terible hotel . The guest services were unhelpful at best , and the inbuilding resturaunts were unsanitary and untasteful . And as for the rooms , small , cramped , and it seemed as if the sheets had n't been cleaned in the last 5 years . My stay here was distasteful , and I never intend to return , except to ask for my money back .
The Homewood Suites by Hilton , in downtown Chicago , has to be one of the most comfortable and affordable hotels in the windy city . After asking the doorman , I discovered all guest suites in the entire establishment feature a two room layout with a fully equipped kitchen . The full sized refrigerator caused me to do a double take , as did the stove and LCD televisions . This is definitely the place to have a home away from home while in Chicago . It 's mind blowing that a hotel this extravagant can have rates as low as $ 40 a night , which is what I payed when I stayed there in September . The atmosphere was warm and cozy , and the staff were all very friendly and professional .
