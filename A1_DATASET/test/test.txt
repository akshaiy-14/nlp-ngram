Extremely disappointed in our stay . This hotel did not look like what pictures portrayed online . I booked online thinking what a perfect place this was going to be , only to arrive and have a room without a view even though that is what was paid for . The room smelled musty and not clean . Garbage was not changed from prior person . Found small ants in bathroom near shower . Called to complain and someone came up 2 hours later and used bug spray . Overall this hotel is in a great location , but we would never visit again . Staff was not overly friendly or helpful and the room was not as all as it seemed online .
The InterContinental Chicago is conveniently located near MIdway airport so the commute was short and easy . The room had a great view of a lake . Room service was available 24 hours a day and the room came with a coffeemaker where you got complimentary coffee and tea which was great I did not have to go out for my morning cup of coffee . There was a business center that had internet , fax machines , and copy machines that was available for use 24 hours a day . One of my favorite things was the fitness center which had masseurs , it was exactly what I needed , very relaxing . The food at the Eno was some of the best I ever ate especially the chocolate , I never wanted to leave . This was a great hotel experience and I would stay there again .
I stayed at Sofitel with my husband for a weekend and I will NEVER be staying again ! The staff was rude , the room was dirty , and the decor is ugly and garish . AVOID at all costs !
I recently made a business trip to Chicago , in which I stayed at the downtown Fairmont hotel . During my visit , I had an aroma-harmony massage . This experience greatly relieved my stress , from all the business meetings I 'd had that day . Candace worked wonders for my neck muscles , especially . This was the only amenity that I sought out , during my trip . My time was very limited . However , the entire staff at this hotel treated me as if I were a valued guest . I 'll definately stay at this hotel again when I 'm in the area . And , I highly recommend the spa !
I booked my weekend Chicago stay at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago because of the location as well as some good reviews I found online . However , my experience at the Hard Rock Hotel fell short of my expectations . When I arrived , well over an hour of check in time , I was told that my room was not yet ready and I was left awkwardly waiting around for another half an hour as I did not want to leave the hotel again before settling in . The hotel staff I interacted with seemed generally uninterested in their jobs , and while I do appreciate that this is a hip hotel popular with a younger crowd , there was an excessive amount of noise on the floor I was staying on throughout the night until about half past four in the morning when it quieted down ( after two calls to the front desk to make complaints about this issue ) . As I am a fairly light sleeper , I woke up several times throughout the night . I would recommend bringing earplugs if you 're also a light sleeper but would like to get in some decent sleep . Overall the hotel looked very nice , but I just felt that my experience was not worth the amount I paid for my room .
My stay at the Affinia last weekend was ideal and I ca n't wait to return . I was in town for a brief personal trip and wanted to have a clean , lovely room near the shopping downtown . Affinia fit the bill . The location was perfect , just one block from the magnificent mile . The decor was modern and sleek , and my room was impeccably clean . They even have a pillow menu ! The price was pretty reasonable , too . I 'll definitely be back .
James Chicago ; the luxurious nice hotel as it was advertised . I did n't want stay in this hotel , but my wife insisted . Ok , so when I booked the ticket , it cost me $ 299 for one room . $ 299 ! I could get a new honeycomb android tablet with dual core processor at that price point ! The room was stylish though , it looked nice . There was a TV , and the beds were fine . Although I could n't quite understand why they had Wifi and no computer . Why would I even need wifi if there is no computer ? What were they thinking ! ? The experience I had with James Chicago was a bit below of what I had expected . I mean the food available there was n't very tasty at all . I had to wait in a long line to get the ticket and I was also hoping to browse the internet , but they had no computer , only wifi . That 's like only having bread , without any fillings to make it into a sandwich !
My husband and I recently chose the Palmer House Hilton for a rare couple 's getaway from our usual life , and an escape it truly provided . There is something to be said for all the modern amenities combined with an aesthetic drawn from a grander and more luxurious time , let alone with ever-elusive accessibility for a wheelchair user ! A bonus was that we did not need to feel like we must lug half our usual household with us , because things like alarm clocks , hairdryers and ironing boards were already there , electronic media even available for rent . With a comfortable bed , control over how the room felt , no need to search elsewhere for coffee and excellent room service at our beck and call , we had to remind ourselves that we had planned to leave our room to take advantage of all the Chicago culture in close proximity . Too often a hotel is an overpriced way to get out of making your own bed in the morning , but the Hilton was a true vacation . Thank you .
The Talbott Hotel claims to be Chicago 's Premiere Small Luxury Hotel . After staying there and experiencing the service , environment , and the hotel in general , I can say with confidence that this just is n't true . I arrived with rather high expectations due to the claims made by the hotel and some of the reviews posted on their website and I was immediately disappointed . No one came to my car to collect my bags and I was forced to lug them inside myself . The doorman was polite but failed to even open the door for me , leaving me to fend for myself while trying to carry my bags . Once inside , the atmosphere was not what I expected . The lighting was poor , leaving the lobby dark and it looked like a dingy setting with a glossy veneer in an attempt to hide the degenerate state of the building . The carpet looked dirty , as if it had n't been vacuumed or washed in quite some time , and up in the corners where the walls met the ceilings there was visible water damage . When I arrived at the front desk , I was forced to wait over five minutes until someone came out to help me . After checking in I went up to my room and was once again disappointed . The bed was very uncomfortable and I ran the shower for ten minutes without ever receiving any hot water . That night I ordered room service . The food took 45 minutes to get to my room , and when it finally arrived it was cold . The fitness center had a very small selection of machines which caused long lines while waiting to use them . I would certainly not recommend this hotel to any of my friends , and probably not to my enemies either . Stay away !
The Amalfi Hotel Chicago portrayed itself to be a luxurious comfortable place to stay . When arriving at the hotel my party and I had over a 20 minute wait just to check in . We were treated like cattle once we were able to check in at their `` private '' counter that their website highlights . It felt as though I was sitting with a bank teller rather than checking in . Not only did the wait and process take seemingly forever , but our reservations were completely wrong . I ended up having to settle for a double non-smoking room when I had reserved a smoking king room . Not having the room I requested and was assured was available is completely unacceptable for the high prices of this supposedly high end luxurious hotel . I was not compensated for having to switch rooms and Audrey our Experience Designer was no help at all even when we called down upon entering the room which smelled of urine and stale booze . I recommend saving a handful of money and checking into a chain hotel in the area . The Amalfi Hotel Chicago is a waste of time and money as far as I am concerned especially when I could stay at a cheaper chain hotel and get better treatment and comfort . Do n't waist your time staying here .
We decided to stay at The James last weekend with our kids . We reserved the `` Family Adventurer with Paul Frank '' . It 's a special offer by the hotel to entice visitors to see the local museums and aquarium . We ended up receiving 2 Chicago City Passes , which ultimately paid for themselves and 4 tickets for the Chicago Children 's Museum . My kids had a ball . We ended the day with a milk and cookies turn down service and a special pair of pajamas that my daughter adored . All in all , a great weekend where my kids were the focus . The adults certainly were n't forgotten since we had a great breakfast in the room the next morning .
My husband and I had a wonderful time at Swissotel Chicago , when my husband went for a trade fair . We got a classic double room for two nights and it was definitely worth the money . Clean and comfortable , chic and new fixtures . The view of the pier was magnificent . Staff were most helpful and prompt when we requested extra towels and pillow . It 's right next to riverside restaurants and river is very pretty .
I just spent the weekend here with my wife , and she loved it as much as I do . I was here several weeks ago for a work trip booked by the company to show our staff off to some big clients , so I did n't have any choice . But when my wife said she wanted to come to Chicago , I knew this was the place to take her . The hotel has n't just been remodeled , it 's been completely redesigned . Things have been moved around to make the flow of the public spaces work better , and the two rooms that I 've seen are showplaces . They are amazing . This hotel is part of a luxury chain , and it 's easy to see why . They offer full room service at convenient hours . I 've been in every eating area now , and they are all great , too . Whether for business or pleasure , you ca n't beat this . It 's a luxury hotel with all the luxurious features you 'd expect . My wife was stunned , and yours will be , too .
I stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers on a recent trip to Chicago , and had a great stay . The rooms were beautiful , the beds comfortable , and the views of the city were fantastic . My room overlooked the river and the city . I felt like I was on a luxury vacation . The hotel has a few different restaurants . I ate at the Chicago Burger Company , which was delicious . The burgers were juicy , and the prices were great . The indoor pool was a great way for me to relax and entertain the kids in between sightseeing activities . Overall , I had a wonderful stay .
Fantastic stay ! The hotel was beautifully decorated and immaculately clean . I chose this place because a friend recommended it plus it was VERY close to my business conference . Here you get the resources and exemplary four star luxury treatment with the downtown Chicago charm . Be sure to try the ribs at South Water Kitchen next door . They are the best I 've ever had . EVER ! If youre in the mood to unwind , you can sample the evening wine tastings downstairs or take a walk and explore the nightlife all around . I had a great time here . From now on , I wo n't stay anyplace else .
I was really expecting a lot more from a quality chain like the Sheraton , but a recent stay at their downtown location in Chicago was somewhat of a disappointment . It started with check in ; I had specifically requested a room with a single king-size bed , but was told at the front desk in no uncertain terms ( OK , rather rudely ! ) that because of some banker 's convention that was going on , I should be happy with the double-bed room that was left . It was all I could do to get a lousy drink voucher for my inconvenience ! The room itself was OK , nothing special though . The cleaning staff must 've just been through , because there was a faint aroma of old washrags still in the air . The internet jack was n't working . It took more than two hours for a maintenance guy to come up to fix it , no apologies given . For the price , I really expected more in the way of customer service from Sheraton . I guess they 're really no better than anyone else these days !
We recently completed our first visit to Chicago and were pleasantly surprised by the Affinia Chicago hotel where we stayed . The hotel has gone to great lengths to offer extra services to their guests , including individual pillow choices , complimentary kits with items designed to enhance the city visit , and fine dining in two on-site restaurants , one of them roof-top with amazing city views . I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Chicago .
I have to say that the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago is a cool place to stay . When I first got there , getting checked in was very fast . The lady at the counter was nice and well spoken . The bellhop had out bags into the room very fast . The room was very hip and cool . There was musical items all over the place . I really loved the Beatles art that was in my bathroom . After being in the room a few minutes , I got a call from the front desk asking me if I liked my room . They also asked me if I would be interested in things like spa treatments and or if I needed to use their business room . I needed some things shipped while I was there , which they had supplies to help me with that . After getting some work done , I called the concierge if there was some really good pizza places around . They gave me information for 3 awesome places . I left and came back after having a night out on the town . They were very understanding that I was a wee bit out of it . I had more than pizza that night if you get my drift . When I got back to my room , the bed was so comfortable . I feel right off to sleep and had a good nights sleep . In the morning I order breakfast , which was really a Philly cheese steak . They will make anything you want anytime of day . I checked out by 9am with my bags feeling rested and very relaxed . Thank You Hard Rock , You Rock !
I was very disappointed with this hotel . The front desk clerk was rude ; she was on a personal call and took 10 mins . to get off the phone . When I arrived in the room the bed was n't made from the last guest and all the towels were dirty . I called down to the front desk and she made me come back down from the twelveth floor for a new room assignment ( on the twelveth floor ) . Once downstairs the clerk treated me as though I had done something wrong . When I arrived in the new room I found the bathroom less than clean ... There was hair all over the floor , toilet and shower . The shower curtain was mildewed and dried toothpaste spit on the mirror . My allergies started to bother me , immediately upon entering the room , so I checked the filter in the air conditioner . Which looked like it had never been cleaned.The comforter was stained and the carpet looked like it never saw a vacuum . While waiting on acceptable room I went to dinner . Which proved to be as bad as the rooms . The lettuce in my salad was brown and slimmy . The steak was rare and I asked for medium . Not to mention , it tasted like rotten meat.The veggies looked like they had been cooked a week earlier and the potato was shriveled and dry . To top the whole experience off ... When I went to turn on the lamp in my final room it electrocuted and the ambulance had to come get me for a 2 day hospital stay .
This hotel is beautiful , it is very modern and has a very luxuary feel to it . The location is wonderful , it is close to magnificent mile and the Navy pier , which was a great place to show the children on our vacation . We had the option of private parking which made a feel secure with our car , and the valet was very nice and helpful . I also take my work with me everywhere I go , So the wi-fi at the hotel was a-plus . They have a wide selection of packages that can include anything from the couple that wants to get away or a family outing . This place is great for the price , due to the looks of the hotel you will be surprised at how affordable it is . This is very nice place and it gives you a feeling of being the queen or king for the duration of your stay .
The staff at the Talbott hotel was completely unresponsive when I told them there were a bunch of drunken teenagers playing ding , dong , ditch . The sheets smelled funny when I arrived and were only changed 6 times during my two-week stay . The room service was very slow and the cleaning crew did not replace my soap , but I did notice the contents of the mini-bar diminished every time the maid service had been in my room .
My wife and me stayed in the Amalfi Hotel Chicago last August in a weekend visit to Chicago . The hotel is located in the 20 W Kinzie St , in the well-known River North District . We got what the hotel promised : gentle staff , a luxury room with a breathtaking view , magnificent meals and a select wine . I also used its well-equipped gymnasium . We paid $ 586 with taxes for two nights . I think it was a good price , taking in account the excellent conditions we got there . I would recommend the Amalfi Hotel to anybody with good taste that visits Chicago .
Last month , my husband and I stayed at the InterContinental Chicago while we were in town for IMTS . Although they were very busy , the service was excellent and very professional . The staff were always smiling and happy to help . InterContinental was conveniently located near Michigan avenue , and the best stores and restaurants in town . The view from our room was great ! Our room was always clean when we arrived home at night , it was decorated nicely , and the beds were extremely comfortable ! We ate at the hotel 's restaurant Zest , and the food was great ! It was by far one of the best hotels we have visited in a while . We will definitely be back !
My stay at The Palmer House Hilton was less than satisfactory . I would have expected much for from such a `` high end '' hotel . The rooms were way over priced , and the service was less than satisfactory . At one point , I left my dirty towels on the floor to be picked up , and when room service came through , they were still there ! On the other side of things , the cup I had left on my desk ( which I was planning to use later ) was gone . My coffee and my towels were also never replaced . I also was astounded that internet service did not come with the price of the room . Rather , it was a `` nominal fee '' . After paying so much for a room , I had hoped to at least have complimentary wifi . My stay at the Palmer House Hilton left much to be wished for . I will not be staying there again .
The Chicago Palmer House disappointed me . I chose it because it a Hilton hotel , but it definitely does not live up to the standard set by this name . My first impression was a negative one when I was greeted by a rather rude staff . My room might have been luxurious years ago , but the general impression was that it had not been cleaned regularly and could use a little freshening . The bathroom was obviously newer but the shower was difficult to use and the water pressure was absolutely horrible . The food served by the room service and at the hotel 's restaurant sounded delicious on the carefully crafted menus , and the high prices made me expect delicate cuisine . The food simply did not deliver its promises . Everything tasted very bland and the portions were ridiculously small . The location of the hotel might seem like an advantage , since it is in downtown Chicago nearby many touristic attractions : however , the windows in my room did not protect me from the constant noise of cars going by . Overall , this hotel would be decent if it did not advertise itself as a luxury hotel and did not use the Hilton name and price range .
We enjoyed our stay at the Swissotel in downtown Chicago . It was elegant , classy , and the service was impeccable . It was very family friendly for us , with the spacious rooms , the kid 's room , and the no smoking policy . We were just a short walk away from shopping and entertainment and the whole family enjoyed the virtual city tour that helped us decide what we wanted to see . The food was delicious and we did n't have to go outside the hotel to find good food . When visiting Chicago again , we will come back . It was a luxurious experience at a reasonable price .

I went to the Homewood Suites in Chicago which is part of Hilton 's famous hotels . I got ta say that this is the worst hotel that I have ever been to . In fact , Homewood Suites is the worst hotel on the face of this planet . I checked out the rooms and their rooms look like the hotel was built in bad shape . In fact , the rooms looked so bad that I wanted to leave the hotel early . I also got to check out the employees who worked for this hotel . I saw one of the employees and when I rung the bell for my room , they ignored me . How could a hotel have the worst service when they are supposed to not ignore you ? One more thing that I hate about this hotel is that the logo did n't look like the actual logo . It looked more like the logo was changed to look more like something a baby could draw . I 'll never go to this hotel again and it wo n't even be in a million years for that matter . This is a hotel that I will never recommend to anyone because of everything the hotel has to offer .
Having traveled to Chicago on business once before , I was looking forward to spending some vacation time in the city and wanted to have the best accommodations for my trip . After some research , I decided that the Palmer House Hilton sounded like the perfect place to stay . And , in a way , it was perfect -- perfectly awful . After reading some positive reviews and checking out the hotel 's website , I was expecting a luxury room that was a notch above the ordinary . However , my standard guest room , which the hotel 's website describes as `` deluxe , '' was very bland and generic and reminded me of rooms I had stayed in at budget chain hotels , not pricier historic hotels , such as this one . The carpeting looked dingy , so I had to wear shoes or slippers any time I walked on it and there was a gap in the curtains that made it impossible to block out the sunlight in the morning -- or the horrendous view of a brick wall that I had from my window . In addition , the sink in the bathroom dripped constantly and was an annoyance all night long . Everything cost extra , including the gym , the pool and the spa , and the restaurant prices were outrageous . This hotel is overpriced , overrated and definitely subpar . I would n't recommend it to my worst enemy .
Located right in the heart of downtown Chicago i visited this hotel on a business trip . The first things i noticed was how friendly the staff is , and how clean the rooms are ( even compared to other luxury hotels ) seeing as i had a night layover before my meeting i decided to stop by the Terrace and get a drink , i got a mojito and i must say i was very impressed , i 've had my share of mojitos and it was one of the better ones , once i retired back to my room i found the sound system to be excellent , bed was soft and the TV did n't appear burned out at all . Overall i give this a five out of five , the staff was helpful and friendly the whole time and the atmosphere was perfect , i wish i could have stayed longer .
The Hyatt Regency Chicago basically caters to guests who want to feel like they 're staying in a Nice Hotel as soon as they enter the lobby . In other words , come here for the looks , not the amenities . They make a big deal out of the fact that their bedsheets undergo a special de-germifying process ... . you know , because a simple washing machine just is n't good enough . To me , this sort of thing appeals to folks who enjoy being picky and narcissistic because they identify these traits with being `` rich '' -- which most of them are not . Meanwhile , the hotel does n't even offer free wireless -- an essential feature for business travelers like me . Obviously I 'm not the intended consumer , though , so I guess I should n't be surprised .
This has been one of the most pleasurable hotels Ive ever stayed at . From the beautiful concourse to the amazing food , Amalfi really exceeds its standards . The in-room spa service was so relaxing and the tang of the wine was incredible . I highly recommend this hotel as I will give my stay a 5/5 stars .
Wow ! Loved the Ambassador East Hotel in Chicago ! It was so close to all the great sights of Chicago like Navy Pier , Lake Michigan , and all the fabulous dining . The hotel was very classy and the rooms were furnished in a traditional , but cozy manner . The entire family loved it , even the dog ... because they are also pet friendly at the Ambassador East Hotel ! We loved the restaurant there , the Pump Room was great , something to please even the pickiest of our eaters . We were there on a family get-away , but asked to see a larger `` suite '' . The suites were gorgeous . I ca n't wait to tell our friends about this place ! Our next business trip to Chicago , we are booking at this hotel . They have the perfect conference rooms and we LOVE the service ! We are definitely coming back !
My family and I were in Chicago for a friend 's wedding . We had asked around to find a hotel that was nice , but affordable and were pointed in the direction of the InterContinental Chicago hotel . The hotel appeared very nice , and to have all the amenities : Room service , WiFi , clean rooms . Unfortunately , as it turned out , appearances can be deceiving . It begins at the desk , where the clerk was downright rude and uncaring . He said they did n't have any rooms available because we did n't make arrangements . It was getting late , and we had no place to go , there were n't any hotels nearby and my kids were starving . I asked if there was anything he could do , and he said that I will have to ask someone else because he was busy . I talked with his manager and after a bit of fussing , the manager apologized and moved us into a room for the night . Apparently , our expectations for what would be the normal amenities for a hotel stay was above standard , because this room was n't even clean and the wifi did n't work . We ordered room service , and it never came , even after several complaints . It does n't end there either ; when we got home we found that the hotel had charged us for the room service . Overall , this was a very frustrating experience , and I would n't stay there again .
From the moment I stepped into the Ambassador East Hotel , I was very much impressed ! ! The entire staff was extremely helpful and very pleasant . The bell staff escorted my husband and I right up to our suite . Our suite was beyond belief . The atmosphere was very classy and romantic . My husband previously arranged for a bottle of champagne to be waiting in our room when we arrived . We had traveled to Chicago , from New York , for a romantic weekend get away . We had dinner that night at the hotel restaurant , The Pump House , and were very pleased . Dinner started with soup and a salad , main course meal and dessert , all for a reasonable price . We did a little local shopping the next day , after a very well rested night in their wonderfully comfortable king sized beds . Every interaction with the staff was a postitive experience . We enjoyed our weekend get away and would most definitely return to the Ambassador East Hotel the next time that we are in Chicago , Illinois . 5 stars ... .
As I walked into the hotel I was greeted warm heartedly . They took my information from me in an efficient manner and got me to my room quickly . I was very pleased to see that my bed was laid out perfectly and that there was plenty of towels in the bathroom . Also , I was happy to see that the shampoo and soap provided was sufficient . Overall , I was very happy with my stay at this hotel .
When I was asked to stay at the Swissotel in Chicago , I immediately went to their website to check them out . What I found there was decent , nothing really stood out . It was n't until I actually went there that my eyes were opened . The amazing customer service I received there was exceptional . Every whim and detail I asked for they helped me perfectly . The room was neatly fixed when I arrived and was cleaned every day . When I asked about more towels , the maids were happy to help me out . If I were ever to be in that area again , I know exactly where I 'm staying , the Swissotel .
The Affinia hotel in Chicago was superb . the room service was exemplary and the food , I do n't even know were to start . The chef obviously knew what he was doing , I especially loved the seafood , my personal favorite was the shrimp . Aside from this , I loved how beautiful the hotel was . It is definetly a bargain for the price , for that price you would probably get a good 3 star hotel but , I felt as if i was in a $ 10,000 a night 5 star hotel in the Europe . great bang for your buck . Would recommend it to anybody looking to relax at a great hotel with great amenities in a great city . My friends actually went their a while back because of me . They loved it ! I know you will too .
The Chicago Hilton is a great hotel our stay there was fantastic . The hotel is placed in the heart of the city were you can find it a easy walk to almost everything from the local colleges to the great restaurant that surround the city . The room itself was clean and the staff was fun and helpful . I ca n't really say anything bad about this place it was a great time and a great place to stay while we were there .
My recent stay at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park was everything I desired and more for my luxury shopping weekend in Chicago . I loved the contemporary style of the rooms complete with modern conveniences like a 42 inch flat screen television and iPod docking station . I appreciated the walking distance to all of Chicago 's premiere shopping areas . The concierge was extremely helpful in booking dinner reservations , while the bellman was excellent at providing me with private car service . The services I received at at mySpa were some of the best in the world . Dinner at aria restaurant was delicious . In short , Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park was the perfect luxury vacation , meeting all my needs and more !
Amalfi Hotel Chicago has several factors that make it one of the best hotels in the chicago area and an experience you will not forget in a long time . Its proximity to some of the best spots in Chicago makes it a visitor 's delight . It is close to the Magnificient Mile which is the shopping area , it is also close to the Loop , Merchandise Mart and Michigan Avenue making it a fantastic location with great layout and it has lots of space . Each guest room includes a flat screen HD TV . The beautiful reception has free snacks and drinks even as the hotel provides free breakfast . The 24-hour fitness centre is always open for business.The hotel has a no-smoking policy . It also has free internet facilities , room service , Air conditioning , laundry/drycleaning , multilingual staff to make communication easy , spa services , heating , conference facilities , satelite tv , brailed elevators and pets are allowed . The Concierge desk offer the best wine available and I must add that the wine is great . The hotel prides itself in making you feel like royalty . The staff are very pleasant and the door men are always willing to lend a hand . The hotel places priority on cleanliness as the rooms are always clean . The hotel makes it possible for you to relax , go shopping in the best stores which are close-by , eat in some of the best restaurants and party in clubs most of which they have entered into some form patnership . They offer great deals for every type of customer . I would definitely recommend this place .
I was going to Chicago last month and wanted a nice hotel that was close to restaurants and shops . I did some research and believed the InterContinental would suit my needs . I sure was not disappointed by my decision ! This hotel lots of historic charm . Despite being a larger hotel , the service was top shelf ! The rooms , while not large by any means , were extremely well-appointed and very comfortable . My kids loved the big swimming pool that the hotel offered . As for me , I was more impressed with the location to the Magnificent Mile . The hotel also has a nice restaurant on-site . The food was very good and , just like the hotel itself , the restaurant provided perfect customer service . Dollar for dollar , the InterContinental in Chicago is a great deal and I will be staying there again .
This hotel was worth every cent . You have not experienced Chicago luxury until you have stayed here . In town for a conference , my colleagues and I never had to leave our hotel for much of anything . Fine dining , entertainment , you name it : Knickerbocker 's got it ! I will definitely return as my wife and I frequent Chicago to visit family .
I recently stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago , Il . From the start , the experience was bad . The room was filthy , there were no towels , and the front desk did nothing to rectify the situation . I will never stay there again . I could not have been more dissatisfied .
For our anniversary this year , my wife and I stayed at the Conrad . We 're from the suburbs , so staying at a nice hotel in the city is a big deal for us . It 's expensive , so we expect the best for our money . This was most definitely not the best for our money . It was n't even a good deal either . The problems began right off the bat . When we got to our room , we were both greeted by a musty smell that seemed to hang throughout the entirety of the room . It was like walking into a dusty attic . When I sat down to watch TV , it turns out it was n't even connected to cable or anything . I kept changing the channel , but it was nothing but static and white noise . I even looked for another remote . After we left our things , we went out for a night in Chicago , but coming back , the smell seemed to have gotten worse . I finally asked the hotel management to come up to our rooms . They moved us to a different room , but they had no explanation for the smell . For a single stay , that was more trouble than it was worth .
I recently stayed at the Hyatt Regency in Chicago , IL , and boy was I surprised . The hotel looks nice from the outside but the smell from the river is noxious . In fact , the smell was so bad one night that it almost made it difficult to sleep or even think of eating . As if this were not enough , the bathroom of my room looked like it had n't been cleaned in a month and their were stains on the `` fresh '' towels . Towards the end of my stay I saw a mouse on the ground floor and could only imagine what other critters may be lurking in the walls .
Fantastic Hotel ! Upscale and luxurious , and in a great location ! Rooms are spacious and comfortable and the staff goes out of their way to treat guests like royalty ! The rooms are tastefully decorated and very clean , the beds are comfortable and even the bathrooms were to die for ! My husband and I had a great time in the lounge and enjoyed many of the amenities . I would definitely recommend this hotel to everyone , and ca n't wait to get back there myself !
I want everyone to know about the awful experience I had at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers . When we arrived at the hotel , the clerk who was checking us in said that our reservation was not in the system ( I had called earlier in the day and confirmed it ) . After speaking to the on-duty manager we were informed that our reservation had been canceled earlier in the day and that the hotel was now completely booked . We later found out that there was a convention at the hotel and that the price for the rooms had risen dramatically . I believe they canceled our reservation just so they could make more money . I for one wo n't be going back to this hotel !
This hotel is dizzying with all of the bold colors and patterns everywhere . It smells because pets are allowed . This hotel is also extremely dirty because of the pets allowed . There was mold in our room and bathroom , pet hair everywhere ! Kids love pools . How can they claim to be kid friendly without one ? My kid was bored . The food was basically the same every day , no variation in the menu . Pictures on their website of the rooms must be reserved for their `` travel club '' because our room did n't even remotely resemble the pictures . They did the old bait and switch . We reserved a `` family room '' . When we opened the door of our room , we realized that it was n't what the website pictured or had what the website described . We kept our mouths shut for fear of retaliation by the hotel workers . Definitely do not recommend this hotel ! ! !
My family chose to stay at the Chicago Hilton during our last trip to the city . We wanted something luxurious and centrally-located without having to pay exorbitant prices . I can honestly say we made an excellent decision in picking the Hilton . The staff treated us well , the rooms were clean and roomy ( we loved the Serenity beds ) , and the hotel itself is stunning . It was like stepping back in time . We loved that the Chicago Hilton was close to numerous attractions . The weather was lovely , so it was great to walk to Navy Pier , Sears Tower , and the Adler Planetarium . We will definitely stay at the Hilton the next time we are in Chicago .
My husband and me reserved a room online for the Chicago Hilton . We were looking for a quit few days away from home and work . Unfortunately what we found was not what we were looking for . First of all the room was smaller than what it appears to be online in the photos . The floors looked like they have n't been cleaned in a while in the check in area . The room we stayed in had very thin walls and we could hear the conversation of the other guest on each side . The staff was horrible . We had asked for a turn down service it was never received . I would not at all recommend this hotel to anyone . Chicago is a great place to visit as long as you do not stay at the Hilton .
I went to stay at this hotel last year . I have got to say it was a great authentic experience , the dining Restaurant was clean and fantastic the rooms were very comfortable with a friendly staff . Its location could n't be more perfect so close you can walk to do some shopping . Looking at it from the outside at night is very beautiful . It is very affordable . I recommend this place to anyone and plan on staying again the next time i come to town .
Hotel is located 1/2 mile from the train station which is quite hike when you 're traveling with luggage and/or kids . They seem to cash in on guests who arrive in private car by charging exorbitant parking/valet fees . Rooms feature either double or king sized beds ; no queen beds at all . If you want a little extra leg room in your bed , the price jump from double- to king-sized is stiff . Rooms with any kind of view pay a healthy surcharge , too .
Upon entering the Hotel Monaco CHicago , i could see the beauty of a classically elegant building . The old fashioned furnishings , the wonderful view , and the polished wood decorating the entore hotel . At first i had been skeptical , but any doubts i had carried into the hotel were gone . As i entered my room , the fresh flowers and the amazing Chicago view greeted me . During my stay i enjoyed my free time lounging by the pool , winding down every night with a comforting massage . I would recommend this hotel not only for the pure elegance , but for the wonderful customer service and the fantastic amenities .
The Intercontinental Chicago Magnificent Mile The outside of the hotel itself is as the name says is pretty magnificent despite being set in what has to be the filthiest section in the city . For the cost of the rooms starting at 179.00 a night , you would think they would have a competent parking attendant . I was delayed from a very important client due to a latency issue with my reserved room , and if that was not enough . To top it off the room service had the nerve to bring up room temperature pasta and a bottle of champagne that had the seal previously broken free of the cork . Needless to say this will be the last time this hotel ever is to grace so much as another dollar bill from my account . I would highly recommend another hotel with better accommodations .
The location of this hotel was superb ! Our room was spacious and the view was spectacular . The staff at the hotel treated my family with the upmost respect . One of the front desk staff even helped my five year old tie his shoes while we were waiting for the porter . We will stay here again and advise our friends to do the same .
Me and my business associate had a job in Chicago and wanted to stay somewhere that had more features . We did some research online and came across the Hotel Moncaco . We decided to stay for 3 nights . When we arrived we noticed that it was in a busy part of the city with bright lights . The staff was upstiff , and did n't not offer much hospitality . Our room did have a view , but of the city lights and kept our room bright , even with the curtains closed . The beds appeared soft , but did not offer much comfort . For what we paid , we expected more .
I was not pleased with my recent stay at the Palmer House Hilton . My room was not ready upon my arrival and the room I was given was not what I had requested . I had requested a room with 2 queen size beds on a lower floor and was not given that . The air conditioning in my room was not functioning properly and it could not be turned off . The room had an overpowering fragrance smell which made my sinuses act up . I wondered what had happened in the room before I got it to make the housekeeping staff use so much air freshener . There was no doorman available or a cart so I had to lug my 3 suitcases by myself by dragging 2 of them about 20 feet and then going to get the other one so as not to lose sight of them at any point since they contained valuable irreplaceable items . Luckily another guest saw my predicament and offered assistance . My room had evidence of the previous occupants that had been left behind and overlooked by the housekeeping staff . They promised to send someone up to take care of the debris and after 3 calls to the front desk I finally gave up . I had looked forward to my stay there but have to conclude that it simply did not live up to the advertising and was a poor value for the money that I spent to stay there .
The Omni Chicago Hotel offers all the great amenities in comfort that is expected of a luxury hotel , particularly speedy and easy wireless internet access and nice-sized plasma tv 's . The windows are big enough to give a spectacular view of the city skyline while reclining on a great sofa in a comfortable and luxurious living room , before sleeping in a king-sized bed of either feather or foam pillows , which is particularly relaxing after taking a bath or shower in the spacious bathroom . An in-room massage appointment will add an additional relaxing aspect to the stay . There 's even an exercise kit within the room for extra convince . However , the vast fitness center is just as worthy to use , as well as the whirlpool , Jacuzzi and the indoor swimming pool . Sunbathing is an easy activity to achieve via the two rooftop sundecks . A nice aspect that is n't so common to find is the ability to have small pets stay with you in the hotel . The Omni Chicago is a great way to add a bit of luxury to any type of vacation , particularly when you do n't want to be separated from your pet , within the area .
Be prepared the hotel is old . It is on the historic list . The is updating to be done no doubt.. So just be forewarned . It is clean and the staff is phenomenal . Having said that , you can not beat the location . Right in the heart of the Gold coast . Take a train from O'hare right into the city . It drops you off only 4 blocks from the hotel . One block from the beach and public transportation is right there . Incredible area to explore . I highly recommend the Ambassador East
My stay at the Amalfi was a very brief one . I booked the hotel based on all of the glowing reviews I saw here on Trip Advisor . When I arrived , I sat down at a desk with an amazingly aloof clerk . I felt like I stepped into an episode of the Twilight Zone . The room was very small and dark . Then the Internet was n't working . I was n't informed about this on my check in and could n't be given a time frame when it would be back up . I walked the neighborhood and found another hotel more to my liking , gathered up my belongings and went there . If you 're one of those people who likes trendy upscale and chi chi locations and hotels , you 'll lurve this place . But if you like a hotel with lights on , working internet and a good view and real breakfast , go someplace else .
this is my new favorite place to stay in downtown chicago , and I 've been to this hotel at least 4 times . the rooms are clean , wonderfully designed and comfortable . The staff is friendly , service focused - and the restuarant is great , especially for the breakfast fruit crepes . Love this hotel . It 's a great location , very good and consistent service and quality .
My parents booked five nights at The James for its location and good reviews . They had a terrible first night with defective air conditioning and not much sympathy from the management staff . They sent engineers three times to repair the unit , and they insisted that it was getting cooler when it was n't , under the rationale that the summer temperature is high and the filter was dirty . At my parents ' request , the hotel staff moved them to a lower floor with a queen instead of a king and with neither a rate discount nor an effort to compensate them for the inconvenience and discomfort . The hotel insisted they were fully booked and reluctantly gave them that room . Do n't book this hotel in the summer . And by the way , there is no view at all from any of the rooms - except for the windows of other buildings .
My daughter and I woke in the morning wanting to go swimming . When we arrived at the pool the water was covered by a white scum . I then attempted to use both of the phones at the pool , one white phone and one emergency red phone , to call the desk . Both were out of service ! ! ! ! I am glad there was n't an emergency . As we were exited the pool area I ran into a hotel employee and told her about the problems and then asked her to call us when the pool was clean ... . never heard back . One more thing , in our room the furniture was mostly child friendly except for a large metal and glass outdated coffee table . Within 30 minutes my 5 year old fell and hit her mouth and began bleeding . They need to update this piece of furniture .
Was one of the worst travel experiences of quite some time ... . 1 . Arrived to construction or renovation to main lobby ... no warning . not on the website ... `` thanks for letting me make the choice to stay in hotel with construction site '' 2 . Lengthy line to wait at makeshift reception area ( 25 min wait ) .. check in..ACHE conference -- be prepared for the influx of people for the convention . 3 . Double book room ... . go back to check in ... told to get back in line ... and we will review when it is your turn ... told them I just waited 25 mins.. Curt service worker said wait your turn . 4 . Second room ... dirty dishes from room service in front of door at our check in at 3PM . 5 . Internet kept dropping and slower than dial up network ... . 6 . Second day and Third day stay ... No hot Water to start the day off with cold shower ... . 7 . Check out ... overcharge on bogus fees ... . Travel to Chicago stay at the Palmer House or Fairmont .
We got this hotel by chance since we decided the spur of the moment to spend a nite in Chicago on 7/24/09 . We went thru Priceline and was lucky to get a room at this hotel for only $ 69 ( normal rate was around $ 200 ) . The room was superb on the 29th floor with a nice king bed . Hotel is only about 1.5 blocks to Michigan Ave so the location is very convenient . Parking is very expensive at $ 50 a nite but we parked right next door at a selfpark for just $ 30 . We decided to have breakfast at the hotel restaurant to save us from walking elsewhere . We ordered the buckwheat pan cakes and egg benedict . They were absolutely delicious which stunned us since we did n't expect this type of experience from a hotel restaurant especially for breakfast . Glad we did n't pick their breakfast buffet since the special menu is much better . I highly recommend this beautiful and cozy hotel for your Chicago visit .
I was apprehensive after reading some of the more negative reviews of the Hotel Allegro . However , our stay there was without problems and the staff could not have been more friendly and helpful . The room was not huge but there was plenty of room to move around without bumping into one another . The bathroom was small but well appointed . Overall , it was a clean and interestingly decorated room and we were pleased . Others have complained about being able to clearly hear people in adjacent rooms but we must have lucked out in that way and did not experience that although we could occasionaly hear people talking in the hallway . One other reviewer complained rather bitterly about the area and said that it was dangerous and I ca n't even begin to understand that as we found it to be extremely safe . The area is also very close to public transportation ( we used the trains exclusively ) and got around quite well without a car . We would most definetly stay here again and recommend it to others .
Our third stay at the Homewood Suites Chicago proved to be just as great as the previous two . The staff are consistently friendly , polite and professional - and this applies whether they are working at the front door , servicing the rooms , managing the breakfast room or on the reception desk . They genuinely seem happy to be working here and ca n't do enough for their guests . The rooms are large and clean and seem to have good insulation from each other ( we did n't hear a thing from our neighbours and the hotel was quite busy ) . The hotel is well placed for walking to the shops on Michigan Ave , or catching a bus or subway . There is a Jewel Osco and a Trader Joes each within a couple of blocks , which are perfect for stocking up on groceries etc . My husband heartily recommends 'Binnies Beverage Depot ' for a huge variety of beer . Now all we need is an excuse to return to Chicago next year - then we can make it four years on the run at the Homewood Suites , because we would n't stay anywhere else !
Perfect location , clean and courteous staff all added up to a great stay . Its in an area with plenty of stores ( The Mile ) and restaurants . Hotel lobby is on the 6th floor and the elevator to get there was annoyingly slow but overall I would highly recommend this place regardless if your there with a family , friends or on business . The subway to Wrigley is a 1/2 block away from the front door .
I travelled to Illinois from the UK on business , and booked Friday and Saturday night at the Homewood Suites so that I could have a weekend in the city . The location was perfect , walking distance to Michigan Ave for all the shopping and touristy stuff , and literally 100 yards to the L ( red line ) for getting out to the surrounding areas . The room was great : not exactly 'wow ' decor but clean and really well stocked . I was expecting a 'suite ' to be a larger than average hotel room with seperate sitting area . It was actually a 3-room mini-apartment , with an open lounge/kitchen , bedroom , and bathroom . Two flatscreen TVs and a huge bed . Breakfast buffet eggs and bacon were great for the hangover ( ! ) , and the kitchen meant that I could cook up some lunch rather than eat out if needed .
Seriously overpriced The room was clean and comfortable but did not stand out from any other mid priced hotel . The `` amenities '' were a smoke screen , nothing was offered that you would not get at a much lesser quality motel but they did not have the basics that you would expect from a Holiday Inn . I would gladly have forgone the scale in the bathroom for a cup of hot coffee that I did not have to get dressed and go down to the lobby to purchase . Being charged $ 15/day for Internet on top of a $ 250/night rate was a bit over the top . The bathroom was not well lit which was inconvenient . The shower was a nice size with a fantastic over-sized shower head , unfortunately twice the water pressure was low so the effect was lost . The staff were friendly and helpful , actually the best part of the stay were the staff . All in all I found it overpriced for the quality of the room .
Let me start by saying we are seasoned travelers who take 5-6 trips for pleasure on a yearly basis ( not including our business travel ) . We 've traveled all over the world and often stay at older hotels because of their charm and attention to detail . We were not at all impressed by this hotel . At $ 220/night we were expecting a decent , clean hotel but obviously not a 5* . We were highly disappointed by the state of the room we were given ( 1546 ) . The paint/wallpaper/tub were peeling , there was hair in both the tub/toilet when we got to the room , the internet service was extremely slow , the toilet ran throughout the night , and quite frankly we were not convinced the bedding was changed from the previous guests as it was wrinkled and look slept in . We told the gentleman working at the front desk about the state of our room and his response was `` I know , we ca n't wait for our renovations . '' If it had n't been for the fact we were meeting up with our relatives who were traveling from the UK & booked into this hotel by a travel agent , we would have checked out as soon as we checked in . Let me also add that the front desk seemed short-staffed as the check-in/check-out process was painfully slow . All we can credit the hotel with is a great location and very friendly/responsive door staff . In its day this was likely a lovely hotel & but it is in dire need of a renovation . Despite its location I can not understand how travelers continue to pay those rates for such a sub-par experience . We would never book at this hotel again .
Overall I had a VERY Bad experience when hosting a meeting for company , but when my parents came in from out of town and wanted to stay at the Swissotel , I thought we should give them another try . Turns out my first impression was correct , this is the LEAST friendly hotel I 've ever been in ! Even the concierge was rude and disagreeable . I could go on and on , but instead I 'll just say GO SOMEWHERE ELSE !
Reservation was for a King size bed , instead I was given a double-bed room . Check-in person must had a bad hair day , because she was unfriendly . Wall St Journal or USA Today is not complimentary . Requested a room that is away from the noisy elevator , but given a room next to a service elevator which is more noisy . I did n't bother to file a formal complain because I was very tire . I travel often to Chicago for business and the first will be the last at Intercontinental .
We stayed in the IC chicago for 6 nights from 26th Dec after reading the reviews on Trip Advisor . We werent disappointed . We had 2 rooms opposite each other in the Historic tower . The rooms were spacious and very clean with good views towards the river and tribune building . We got a good rate on the rooms but did not have breakfast in the hotel as it was very expensive as was the Wifi at $ 17 per day . As the hotel is on the Magnificent mile there are plenty of place to eat including for breakfast . The starbucks in the lobby was a hit with the kids - very handy . I would definitely recommend the hotel .
After reading so many great reviews I booked the Hotel Monaco and was not disappointed . I booked through their web site about 2 1/2 months prior to arrival for $ 170/night plus tax for a room with 2 queens . The location was perfect - right by the river near Michigan Ave. - minutes walk to the El , Millenium Park , the Theater District and Shopping . The room was clean , a little larger than standard and nicely decorated . We had window seats in the room with a view of the river . There was Starbucks coffee in the lobby in the morning and a wine reception in the evening . To top it off , the staff was very friendly and knowledgable about the area .
I stayed in a Deluxe King Suite . No desk to work at or to sit at to eat room service meals . The only table was coffee table height and the couch was some strange futon that was lower than the coffee table ( ! ) and canted forward . Incredibly uncomfortable to sit at and ridiculous for room service meals or to work at computer . Since my room was configured like all the other Deluxe King Suites depicted in on line photos , I have to assume this design flaw with the couch/futon runs throughout the property . Bed was fine and bath was fine but I ca n't imagine why business travelers would rate this property well . The couch/futon seating is the worst I 've encountered in a modern hotel .
Excellent location , about a block from Michigan Ave. and two blocks from Water Tower Place and John Hancock Tower . Beautiful hotel , felt very luxurious and high-class for being a moderate priced hotel . Staff was excellent -- friendly and accommodating .
Ideal location right in the heart of the Near North side but good grief , they need more than two elevators . You can wait 10 minutes for an elevator and if you happen to be on the first floor ( registration desk on 6th floor ) , you can face a long line just to catch one . Rooms are from the same cookie cutter as all Homewood Suites - very utilitarian ; unlike many locations however , this one does not include a DVD player in the rooms . The pool is OK but there 's no jacuzzi . Oh , and housekeeping is deficient when it comes to keeping the towels stocked in the pool area . Front desk service is pretty good .
All I can say is avoid this place at all costs . From the reservations assistant ( who took 45 minutes to book a room ) to check out ( they billed my card for 750 dollars ) and getting a refund ( numerous voicemails and emails no one returned my call ) . AVOID AVOID AVOID a truely hideous experieince I will never stay at a Starwood resort again , and given I stay in a hotel 4 or 5 days a week this is a big statement !
I stayed in this hotel for 5 days in November together with my colleagues . Internet only wired available for 20 additional dollars a day . No fridge or microwave included in the price . Our room had two too soft full size beds . In the hall way the wallpaper had come off the wall . Who doesnt believe it , check out the 16th floor close to room 212 . With discount we paid more than 300 dollars a night which is ridiculous . I stayed in the Hyatt Regency before for much cheaper and that was way better . The restaurant in the main hall is very nice and the food is tasty , but although being almost the only customer it took forever that the food got served . please stay away and take one of the plenty alternatives nearby .
My wife and I just returned from a 3 night stay at the Amalfi Hotel in Chicago and enjoyed everything about the Hotel . Most importantly our room was perfect with plenty of space , great jazz CD 's in the room , wonderful bathroom and one of the most comfortable beds I 've ever slept in . The staff was very helpful with every request . The Amalfi offers a great continential breakfast on every floor each morning with good coffee and a great selection of pastry 's , fruit 's and jucie 's . We also enjoyed the managers receptions one evening where they offer a great choice of complementary cocktails and antipasta 's for their guests . Would highly recommend this hotel .
I have stayed at many hotels traveling for both business and pleasure and I can honestly stay that The James is tops . The service at the hotel is first class . The rooms are modern and very comfortable . The location is perfect within walking distance to all of the great sights and restaurants . Highly recommend to both business travellers and couples .
Check-in was fast , the room was perfect , and there were no problems . This is a standard big-city business hotel with every amenity imaginable . I got a very good deal for a one-night stay , but they made the money back from the exorbitant parking rate and the absurd access fee for wireless internet . If you are bored of the routine hotel fare , walk two blocks to Gourmet Pantry ( 155 N. Michigan ) for a refreshing change .
I travel often for business and this hotel ranks very low on my list . The room had such a strong odor of smoke , it gave me a headache ( and I used to be a smoker ) ! The room service was mediocre and extremely expensive . The hotel is disturbingly huge . Very difficult to navigate your way around it . I waited on hold for twenty minutes to ask a concierge where a pharmacy was located . She curtly gave me cross-street names and hung up . Uhhhhh , how do I know which direction to go in ? ? ? Stains on the carpet in the room . A big gauge in the wall , where maybe a thermostat once was ? ? ? The shower is decent . All in all , for the price they charge , NO THANKS ! ! ! I 'm just glad my company is footing the bill .
My husband and I stayed here for New Years eve weekend . This is an excellent hotel in an excellent location . Hotel is very tastefully decorated and warmly welcoming . The rooms had the best electronics I 've ever seen . Loved that they had a soaking tub and a spacious shower stall . The hotel restaurant seemed to be empty everytime we walked by , so we avoided it too . Ate at Joe 's across the street - excellent seafood . And you can shop til you drop without going outside ! Nordstroms and four story mall is attached . Lots of good `` food on the run '' places in there . Loved Chicago - loved the Conrad . I will go back !
My friend and I stayed for just one night , and loved the hotel . It had an awesome water feature in the hotel , and great large bar . Like all Hyatts it had a very comfortable bed , lot 's of pillows , and large bathroom .
Ok , so first trip to chicago and I was a litlle worried about the hotel and the location , finally I decided on the CONRAD and wath a good experience i had , I booked a king deluxe room on the 6th floor , view was not amazing but that was the only coplaint i could had , room is nice , bath was all appliances and good size , good plasma tv , free internet , we asked one day for breaksfast and amazing food ! so overall and for the price aroufn 220 It was a great surprise , the locating was very good a few blocks from everything and very quiet hotel
OK , we are back from the Knickerbocker and I would give it the best rating . I ca n't believe the bad reviews . I got a priceline deal , and I still got a fine room , clean , up-to-date furnishings ( OK a little traditional for my taste ) and smoke free . Someone said in another thread that some people write prank reviews . I think such people should get a life because people want to read the truth . Here it is from my point of view . Both rooms on 10th floor . Regarding the size of the rooms . We had two rooms . One was a 2 double bed room . It was about 20 ' x 15 ' . Each double bed had valences that were kind of mini-canopies . The furniture , bathroom tile , shower ( no tub ) , wall paper and paint had been done in the last few years . A Chinese inspired cabinet held TV , coffeemaker , ice bucket , and mini-bar . Three separate levels ( TV , ice/coffee , and minibar ) The other room was called `` Queen executive '' . This one had queen bed with more of a canopy than valence , sofabed , two TVs and terry bathrobes . Also about the same size but different configerations . One TV faced the bed , other in the three level cabinet , the sofabed . Smoke in the lobby . There is a bar to the right of the entrance . It is an open arrangement so that I am sure the smoke comes from bar to entrance door . No smoke smell in no-smoking rooms . Cost of rooms $ 75 on priceline plus taxes . Very good value one block from N. Michigan Ave. Only complaint . Concierge said that the free trolley did n't go down Michigan Ave to Field Museum/Museum complex when in fact it does . Was this ignorance ? or trying to throw more business to taxi ? Either case , not good . He said at this time of year free trolley only goes to Navy Pier during winter ... .which is clearly incorrect .
As I sit here in my 14th floor room at the hotel Allegro , I listen to the conversation between husband and wife in the room on my left . She seems to have a cough today . In the room on my right , someone seems to use the restroom quite a bit . I hear the water running and the toilet flushing . I also hear footsteps in the room upstairs . Even roadside motels have better insulation between the rooms . I 've stayed in about a dozen Kimpton hotels and this is by far the worst . The room is dirty - the carpet covered in spots and stains , the curtains with a large brown stain ( I do n't want to guess what it is ) , paint peeling , rips in the wallpaper . The decor is a bit garish , with Pepto-Bismol covered walls , green and yellow pillows and the filthy brown and white carpet . The size of the room is fine and the bed comfortable , but I 'm so glad I had earplugs to avoid listening to others ' toilets flushing all night . The location is good for downtown theaters or business . Only three elevators serve this 17+ storey building and they run very slowly . Chicago has many nice hotel options -- many I 've enjoyed quite a bit . Unfortunately this is not one of them , and even more unfortunate for me : I 'm stuck here for two more nights . I was looking forward to staying here because most Kimptons are hip , comfortable and attractive . This is not .
After reading the Trip Advisor reviews , I was expecting an exceptional stay . I was not impressed overall . The concierge , the view , and the hotel resturant were the highlights . The bed , although not horrible , was not nearly as comfortable as mine at home , and I do not consider myself and extremely fussy person . I was traveling for business , and although not dressed in formalwear , was also not dressed down , but all in all , it felt a bit pretentious to me . There are better options for the money , and would gladly stay at the Sutton Place , Sheraton Towers , or Trump for the similar price and better stay . I would ask Trip Advisor to move it down in the ratings ... ... not # 1 in Chicago , in my book .
Overview : -- Overrated hotel in a premium location . The Great : -- Location - walking distance or cheap cab ride to a ton of great restaurants , bars , and sights . The Good : -- Inviting lobby , pleasant staff though a few were a bit snobby , in particular the night deskman . -- Nice bathroom , comfortable bed and desk chair . The Mediocre : -- Room ( excluding bathroom ) was underwhelming in design . -- No kitchen or bar though they have limited room service from Harry Caray 's across the street . -- Free cocktails 5-7pm in `` lounge '' is right idea with wrong execution ; tiny little room packed with people and a line extending out the door . -- Hot water ( or lack thereof ) - almost every morning my shower water temperature would waver between comfortably hot to lukewarm . Pressure is pretty low . -- View - mine was n't great but apparently some of the rooms are horrible . The Bad : -- Free wi-fi / ethernet has inconstant speeds and required multiple logins every day , even when my computer was n't moved - really aggravating . Same deal for my iPhone . I also got numerous vulnerability threat warnings from my Norton Anti-virus that makes me wonder how secure it is . -- No blackout curtains ! I had a corner room with a huge wrap-around window and awoke to bright sunlight every morning ( not to mention a near total lack of privacy at night ) . Never had this issue in any hotel or motel I 've ever stayed at . -- Noise ! - the hotel is sandwiched between a few different bars and the late night cacophony of yelling , bar music , trucks , car horns , and sirens is hugely distracting well into the early hours of the morning . I had to wear ear plugs despite being on the 5th floor . -- TV had crappy HD signal with out of sync audio on every channel . And the remote was useless . -- In room bar had standard inflated prices but the $ 7 bottle of Fiji water bedside was insulting . Do n't even think of opening it ; there 's a 7-Eleven around the corner that sells exact same bottle for a fraction of the cost . Summary : -- Not recommended . Looks much nicer in the website photos than it is . Rating on Yelp is bloated by at a least a star .
This morning , I checked out and left behind one of the worst hotel experiences I 've ever had : Hard Rock Hotel , Chicago . I am in disbelief that this hotel is part of the `` Preferred Hotels '' group . Upon checking in , I was `` greeted '' by a front desk staff that had better things to be doing and let it show . My room was poorly lit and dirty . The desk/desk chair was covered in sticky , dried soda pop ( or something else ? ) which I had to clean myself so I could work . The `` sound system '' was put to shame by my 10-year-old daughter 's boombox . No one , rock star or otherwise , wants to reach more than an arm 's length for toilet paper . Everything is possible . This includes hiring professional and courteous staff to answer customer calls that are directed to the `` everything is possible '' line . Great marketing fails with no follow through . The in-room mini-bar policy ranks in my personal top-five most ridiculous business practices of all time . Do you charge Steven Tyler $ 7.81 for opening his in-room 'fridge ? Looking back , I would have much preferred enjoying cocktails in my dirty room rather than the dirty , drafty , overpriced bar ( with a horrendous wine list ) With the exception of the fact that I was leaving , check-out was no better than checking in . I was n't even asked about my stay ! The young woman who provided me with a copy of my bill could not have been more unpleasant . I , for one , will not bring my business back to that location . Next time I 'm in Chicago , I 'm staying at the Hyatt . Rock on , TripStarr
First , several day s prior to my stay , I called and spoke at length with the concierge and made a breakfast order for room-service Saturday and Sunday . Saturday they did n't bring breakfast - and when I called room-service they stated they never got the advance order from the concierge . When they finally did bring it - they brought the wrong thing.. and then brought the wrong order again on Sunday . I was further inconvenienced by in-room dining staff when we ordered room service Saturday night . The food was limp and uninspired . Further , I ordered soup - which arrived without a spoon . When I called in-room dining to request a spoon , I was told one would be forthcoming . 15 minutes later , a waiter arrived with a menu . When I explained I already had food and I did n't need a menu - I needed a spoon , he had the audacity to argue with me . I respectfully requested he return with a spoon and he agreed to do so . Another 15 minutes ( and one bowl of cold soup ) later I decided to call in-room dining back to request ( again ) they send someone with a spoon . They too argued with me and expressed that they 'd already sent someone with a spoon . I explained that they had not - that I had received a menu I did n't request , but that no spoon was forthcoming . Another 15 minutes later , a spoon finally arrived . Thanks - for charging me $ 100+ so that I could argue over cold , flavorless food . In addition to the gross customer service , surly attitude , and sorry food , I found the room woefully lacking . It reeked exhaust fumes so much so that on Saturday night I woke up from the smell . Further , I had specifically requested when I booked the reservation that you keep me away from the elevators ... I was right next to the elevators and had the displeasure of listening to them ding all night long as other guests came and went .
This review has two parts . . .I advise reading both . Chapter One : The actual hotel and staff I found the in house staff to be very friendly and accommodating . The room was nice and clean as well . I have no disagreement with any of the other reviews regarding the hotel room or the staff . This is a great location where you can walk three blocks to to the South to reach the riverfront , or a few blocks to reach the water tower to the North . Very easy ( one block ) walk from the subway ( Red line ) . The morning complimentary breakfast is substantial . Not just muffins and coffee . You can have a complete breakfast here if you want . And , even the breakfast servers were really nice and efficient . I would recommend this hotel IF based solely on the physical location , the room , and the staff . Chapter Two : The nightmare I booked this room through central reservations in July for a mid-September arrival . The rate was quoted to me as $ 159 per night for four nights . When the confirmation was emailed to me , it was incorrect by over $ 300 . I immediately called the hotel . They said they made the correction and emailed a new confirmation with the correct amount . I did receive the corrected confirmation email . . .All done ? NO . One week later , my credit card statement arrives with the old higher amount having been charged . I called the hotel and was transferred to central reservations to resolve . When I explained the error , I was literally called a liar by the person in reservations , and told `` That 's not my problem . I ca n't help you '' . . . and then told that I have to pay the higher amount . Excuse ME ? Now , I go back to calling the hotel manager to get some assistance . After a few left messages , I get the general manager to call me back , and discuss the issue . After taking down all of the names of people I spoke with , he assures me that he will credit the account immediately . I even get a call from someone in his accounting dept to confirm my credit card etc . . . One week later , still no credit . So , I call the general manager again . Oh , this might take up to 72 hours to process , I am told . So , please give it another week . Another week passes , still no credit . So another call to the manager . I am told now that the credit HAS been processed , and he even sends me an email confirming our `` agreement '' for the credit , just to appease me . Another week passes . Still , not seeing that credit that was `` definitely processed '' a week ago . Yet another call to the general manager on the day before I am to leave on my trip to Chicago . I told him I will be arriving , and at this point , I want to see him personally , and he can physically use my credit card to process the credit while I am there . Remember , we are now talking SIX WEEKS and this is still not resolved . I arrive at the hotel , and to make a long story short , the general manager was NEVER available to see me , nor did he make any attempts to schedule any time to see or talk with me . The only person I spoke face to face with , was the assistant general manager . He was completely unconcerned with my situation , and made the completely inappropriate statement to me of `` you realize this boils down to a matter of 'he said she said ' '' . . . WHAT ? ? ? ? Today , my trip is over , and I have flown back home . I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE CREDIT TO MY ACCOUNT ! ! ! I will absolutely be reporting all of this to Hilton Corporate Customer Service , and will absolutely be disputing the entire amount at this point . Take this little adventure into consideration when dealing with this hotel .
I stayed at the intercontinental during the last weekend in September for a `` pleasure trip '' -- the InterContinental was in a great location and the staff was excellent . The room was clean and comfortable -- and came equipped with a new LG flat panel tv . Had breakfast at Zest ( hotel restaurant ) -- a bit pricey but decent if you want a buffet . The hotel is in walking distance to millenium park , museums and the aquarium . There is also a lot of shopping - window shopping is best though , considering the sales tax is 9.5 % ! ( and possibly raising to 11 % ) Great stay . I highly recommend it and would stay there again .
We have just returned from a week at the James Chicago . The hotel is fabulous , very chic and chilled . The service is beyond compare . Check in and out were swift and painless . The Concierge service is also super efficient having located an excellent hair salon and a couple of fab restaurants for us during our stay . The hotel restaurant itself is rated 5 in the top 10 in Chicago - voted by Chicago residents . We stayed on the 14th floor with great views of the city . The room ( a deluxe king ) was equipped with a great selection of cocktail making lovelies , hairdryer , safe , tv , robes & slippers , a very interesting selection of minibar items ( one of which was a real surprise ! ) including crisps/snacks a first aid kit and an umbrella ! We also had a spotless and elegant bathroom with Kiehls products and a cosy little dining area . The ipod dock/CD/radio and complimentary chillout CD were a nice touch and husband liked the enormous plasma tv . The super comfy bed ensured a good snooze and complimentary WiFi allowed us to plan our next day 's activities from our bedroom . We were so busy touring around the city we did n't get an opportunity to use the gym or the spa - both of which looked fab . The bar/lobby area is a haven of civilised tranquility with smooth music playing in the background to help you chillout that bit more . Staff are attentive without being fussy and a good selection of drinks and bar snacks are available . The barman mixes a mean mohito ! This hotel is full of nice little thoughtful touches to make people feel welcomed and cared for e.g . The Virtual Tuck In service - basically a couple of PCs with webcams to allow people to say goodnight to their children when they 're away from home on business . Also the dog biscuits and water outside the front door for our furry friends . Next visit to Chicago I 'll definitely be staying here and would n't even consider an alternative if The James can maintain these standards .
What 's not to like ? -- > Problems getting the room you actually reserved : I had to call this hotel three times and email four times in order to insure that we actually got the room we had reserved . -- > Overcharging . They charge for everything here . Wireless . The Fitness Center . The Business Center . I 've only run into one other hotel that ever charged for use of the fitness center . Note to the Intercontinental : If you 're going to charge for something that is commonly included , you should advertise that fact . What 's next ? Charging for sheets on the bed ? -- > Very poor customer service . The staff does not communicate in full sentences , or wait to hear your answer . This is Chicago , not New York . How about a little Midwestern patience ?
The Good - excellent location , neighborhood is pretty and quiet , close to shops , restaurants , the waterfront , close to train/subway station , etc The Bad - Very old decor , which is n't a big deal , but the tv was smaller than my PC monitor . We were supposed to have a king bed ( anniversary trip ) we were given two double beds and told we would be switched - that never happened . The shower/tub was stopped up so bad that after I showered my husband waited over one hour for the tub to drain before he could shower . Who wants to shower in someone else 's dirty water even if it is your wife . The indifferent - room was a decent size , bed linens were okay , staff was mediocre to marginally rude
Got a great deal through Hotwire for $ 70 a night but if I ever return to Chicago I would definitely stay again , even at full price . We really liked the rooms muted modern decor , we had John Lennon and Bono for company . Comfortable bed , mini coffe maker , plenty storage space and a lovely , clean bathroom stocked full of Aveda products ( so I was sold straight away ... it does n't take much , I know ! ) . If you 're a product junkie , tip the maid and request some extra bottles and you will leave with lots of goodies : ) We liked the location and had a great view down N Michigan Ave , found the staff to be really friendly and relaxed ( reception , gift shop and bar ) . The bar area is very trendy , I liked the chilled atmosphere which surprised me cause I normally find these types of bars a bit too pretentious for my liking ... the lack of memorabilia did n't bother me but I was more interested in the art deco features of the building itself anyway . The only fault was that the speakers in the room were crackling a bit oh , and my boyfriend thinks he was propositioned by a `` friendly lady looking for business '' when he was at the bar . I think it 's a place you will either love or hate , if you like laid back , contemporary hotels without the intimidating factor then this is the place for you !
My wife & I celebrated our anniversary at the Knickerbocker & could not have been treated better . Before we were out of our cab , our bags had been loaded on a cart & we were walked into the hotel by a doorman . The rooms were well appointed & the entire hotel staff was very friendly . This is a prime location for shopping , sightseeing or nightlife .
I wrote an email to the sales & reservation team a week ago ... ... ... i 'm still waiting for a response . All I wanted to do was book a suite for 2 nights but they failed to even reply with an offer . We have now booked another hotel who can be bothered to answer emails . Shame you missed out , coz we tip like rockerfellers ! !
I recently returned from a trip to Chicago with my husband and baby and another couple and their baby . While the room at the hotel was quite nice we had a very negative experience with the front desk staff including managers . When we arrived it took over an hour to check in . We had requested two rooms on the same floor , which the hotel staff had confirmed a number of times prior to our arrival . When we arrived they could not accommodate us and offered nothing to us to make up for it . Eventually after we persisted they gave us half off for our room for one of the three nights we were there . We also asked the concierge to make us a reservation for brunch at a restaurant that would accommodate 4 adults and two babies in strollers . When we got to the restaurant they had only a reservation for 4 adults and had to make special arrangements to fit the babies in . We also had asked the hotel to make us an appointment for a personal shopper at Bloomingdales in order for us to save time shopping . We filled out forms in advance to direct the shopper and when we arrived for our appointment Bloomingdales advised us that they had only received the applications moments before and had not pulled together our requests . After complaining again to the manager at the hotel of these disappointments she advised that she would send something up to our room to compensate . This `` something '' never arrived . We will not be making a return visit to this hotel . While the housekeeping staff , location and room were quite nice the over all experience was very negative .
The Talbott Hotel itself is a bit worn around the edges . No - not a bit worn - very much so I 'm sorry to say . Although the location a block and a half from the best part of Michigan Ave. ca n't be beat , and the level of service is on par with many Four Seasons , there were quite a few bumps in the road . Number one , the rooms are quite dreary - brown on brown is just so not pleasing . The desk chair was so badly worn that the `` lift '' button simply swirled down when you sat in it and no we 're not grossly obese . The back of the chair leaned so much it was uncomfortable . My husband had to use 2 couch pillows to use it - one to get him up to desk heighth , one up against his back to scoot him up to the desk . The bathroom was oddly arranged so that the door swung up right next to the sink , so if you were using the far sink and someone needed to enter the bathroom you got hit with the door . The towels were very well worn and thin , although bath sized , which was a plus . The restaurant downstairs is practically another posting - suffice to say , it was horrific . We had some appetizers outside on the nice streetside tables , and they ( appetizers ) were awful and looked as though a child had tossed them together in the kitchen . A room service sandwich ordered later in our visit was totally wet on the side , served on a large white plate , and was one slice of meat and one slice of plastic American cheese on a grocery store-like roll - very very sad . Even the menu , as limited as it was , looked as though someone 's child had written it out . The good news is that Chicago is a fairly well-read restaurant town so there are plenty of other places to go . Unfortunately for us , the 3 days we stayed there was a large convention and jazz festival in town so we paid $ 325/nt for our disappointments . The good news is that the mini bars ' wares were incredibly well-priced - when 's the last time you had a $ 4 beer anywhere in a hotel ? ( even if it was Bud and Bud lite - lol ! ~ ) The front desk and curbside staff could not have been more accommodating . The water out of the shower was hot and plentiful , and the bed comfortable . The A/C was not noisy nor uncomfortable whatsoever , and we had it going the entire time as it was in the 90 's our entire stay . Free wi-fi - YES ! And it was n't horribly grindingly slow ! No need for the advertised `` upgrade '' for faster wi-fi . Talbott - please update your rooms and get a new restaurant concept and you will be ahead of the game . Apparently there are enough folks getting deals on rooms here so they are pleased , but we were sadly not .
I asked for a high floor away from the elevator and that is what I got . The room was pleasantly decorated , functional and very clean . I did n't need a whole lot of service but when I did they were pleasant and prompt . I used the fitness center which was well equipped and everything was in working order . It is in a great location at one end of the Michigan Avenue shopping district .
Great front desk staff , the rest of the experience was dreadful . The room service staff have to be among the most poorly trained I have ever encountered . We had to ask FOUR times for the staff not to slam the supply closet , adjacent to our room ( almost in the room itself ) . They do these random room checks for the minibar , as if the entire budget hinged on the sale of a can of $ 9 peanuts . The roomservice is also equipped with walkie-talkies as loud as megaphones . If you like sleeping in on your vacation , do n't stay here . Also , the hotel was under massive construction , a detail that was conveniently excluded from the website . SO we had to take the elevator with construction workers just about every time we used it . No discount because of the work and noise . I 'd rather sleep in a box in the alley .
The hotel was undergoing renovations so it was dirty and noisy . The entrance was really scary since it was covered with scaffolding , making it dark . They charge a lot for internet hook up , wifi is not included . The staff was very slow , I am assuming they were all new . They could not say where anything was or what attractions were nearby . The room was set up weird , the bathroom opened facing the bed , rather than the hall as most do . Room temp was hard to control , even though they had a digital thermostat . Overall I was very disappointed , had I been staying more than one night I would have switched hotels .
I 'll keep it short . My wife , daughter and I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights . We go on several vacations a year and this was a great hotel . Location : It is located in the center of the Magnificent Mile ( Michigan Ave. ) , so it is near or easily accessible to everything you might want to do . Hotel : The hotel itself is very clean , as were the rooms . Maid service was excellent , including 2x daily cleaning and turndown service ( I think they missed a night ) . Service : Every staff member we encountered was super friendly and kind . They always have someone at the lobby door greeting you with a smile . Every night we had milk and cookies waiting in our room ( sometimes chocolates on our pillows ) . They always pushed the elevator button for you if they were near it . There was no shortage of people to ask things . My only conplaint was that the congierge was tough to get . They shouuld have more than one , or longer hours . Other : We had breakfast in the 676 Restaurant and it was very good , and well attended , appointed . They even carried my wifes plate to the table from the buffet . The pool was a nice addition and a hit with the kids . It was nice to go for a swim after a long day of walking . Pool and changing areas were spotless . Room : Clean , sunny and spacious . Probably over 400 sq . ft. - 2 TVs , couch , desk , chairs - all in perfect shape . The windows open for some fresh air . Pillows were pretty comfortable . With all aspects considered , I think this was an unbeatable value ! I would not hesitate to stay again or recommend it to a friend . I truly have nothing negative to say about the hotel . It was a wonderful stay and we will miss being there . Omni has hit the right formula to make a guest feel like a welcomed person as opposed to just a nuisance or a number . The airlines have cornered the market on that .
Not a good start when the front desk is n't willing to tell their customers that they have a problem with your room ! We reserved a King Suite , and the hotel put us in a Queen Suite without telling us up front . Only after we confronted the Manager did they come clean about the switch , he offered us a free breakfast , but would not up-grade our room . The whole problem could have been avoided if they would have told us the truth and let us decide if we still were willing to stay at the Omni . We will not be retuning to this Hotel again .
a great hotel , we used the CTA the 2 days we were in Chicago and it is great , that the Line 6 stops nearly in front of the hotel . So we did not need any taxi and traveled from Midway to the city and to Ohare for 9 $ and we used the buses alot ( freezing cold ) . The hotel itself is great , very clean rooms , realy on of the best bathrooms i ever had . Staff very friendly , they even found me out were i can get Timerland shoes ... . and she was right i got them in one place she told me ... thats service ... I also was having a look to the gym room and the swimming pool area , did not use it and I do not know if it would have been included in the room price ... .but realy a nice view makes running easyer ... .
Stayed at the Talbott for over a week and enjoyed our stay . Room was a little noisy as we were next to the lift , but everything else made up for that . Positives : Bed was very comfortable , great to have real shower , free internet , gym usage , staff ( all friendly ) and location . Negative : Lift noise , lifts slow and restaurant ( there are so many great restaurants around - do n't bother staying in ) Would stay again !
We booked this hotel for an adult weekend away on Priceline , paid $ 85 which thought was good price for a 4* in downtown Chicago . The location is great . The hotel minimally OK > Unsure how it gets a 4* rating . It is old and though clean the decor is definitely jaded and needing a face lift . Staff were pleasant and overall it was a good stay . However I would NOT recommend this hotel . I would rather have paid $ 100 and got something more updated - trouble with old it tends to look somewhat seedy and this was true in this case . My suggestion DO NOT BOOK PRICELINE FOR CHICAGO IL AND ASK FOR 4 * BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT YOU ARE ALMOST SURE TO GET ... ..NOT GOOD ENOUGH PRICELINE. ! ! IN MY OPINION .
Stayed at the Fitzpatrick as a result of all of the glowing reviews on TripAdvisor and to avoid the normal corporate hotel . Good location but the room was dirty , and not just from the last housekeeping . It was dingy : a place where you needed the slippers they provided . And this was a suite . Also , the refrigerator was caked with ice and did n't work . Furthermore , because my travel agent had mixed up the dates I was to travel , I showed up a day late . The hotel said it was n't a problem and that I would n't be charged for the no-show the night before . I had my travel desk verify this with the hotel management the same day . Then the Fitzpatrick charged me for both nights and refused to reverse the charges after many attempts to resolve . Neither I nor my corporate travel desk will use the Fitzpatrick again . Two dots only because it 's in a good location and because the lobby was clean . I 'm generally easy to please and slow to complain but this was bad .
I booked this hotel with great expectations . I had family visiting from outside the country and wanted them to have a good experience in Chicago . Upon arriving to the hotel ( at the exact time I indicated in my reservation ) I was told I 've been `` downgraded '' to a lesser quality room . I travel very often and never had this before . Moreover , I did not hear a single `` I 'm sorry '' , it was like usual business . What bothered me the most was that the receptionist kept telling me `` I will decrease the rate for you '' `` what do you think , nice eh ? '' like he was doing me a favor ! ! ! ! They decreased the rate to that of the rooms they gave us of course ( which is the legal thing to do , since I am sure is illegal to charge me for one room and give me a lesser value one for the same money ) . They did not care that I wanted higher level room independent of value . I did not know what to say , since this never happened to me before , also with family present did not want to start arguing . The rooms were nice ( not as nice as I thought ) and location is good , however be aware that they might not honor your reservation and not even apologize for this . That is enough for me not to go back again .
Great place , great room , great location . Even though there was a big meeting going on ( Rainbow Girls in all their enormous gowns ) the only consequence for us was slow elevators . Ballroom is amazing , shops on ground floor a nice throwback . Lake views from upper floors -- we were on 17 I think -- are worth it . Concierge advice about restaurants etc was excellent . Definitly would return .
We booked 2 rooms for 2 nights on Hotwire over Labor Day weekend . We arrived at the Hard Rock at around 10:00 a.m. , and they were able to give us our rooms early . Hooray ! We were on the 5th floor ( Beatles theme ) . The rooms were very comfortable . One of our rooms was on a corner , and had lots of windows . The other was was a bit larger with fewer windows . Not a great view from our side of the hotel , but we did n't pay for a room with a view . The beds and pillows were EXTREMELY comfortable , the bathroom was full of Aveda products , and there was a bathrobe in the closet . The tv/dvd/stereo combo was nice , but we were n't in the room a lot to use it . We were warned by the front desk not to even touch the snacks/drinks as they were weighted and we 'd be charged . No problems there . We did not make use of the free fitness center , because the weather was perfect . My husband was able to go for a run through Grant Park along the waterfront instead . He said it was wonderful . We did use the free internet in our rooms . It was 'wired ' internet , but my stepdad said that was better for him anyway . The room was a bit dim at night , but we were able to read just fine using the bedside lamps . There was virtually no hall / elevator noise . The location of the Hard Rock is ideal . It is easy to get breakfast at the Corner Bakery , just blocks to either Grant Park , The Art Institute , State Street Shopping , or Michigan Ave. To sum up , there was absolutely NOTHING to complain about . We would be glad to stay here again any time .
I was attending a training conference in Chicago and opted to book my own room thru one of the online discount programs rather than stay at the rather sterile and pedestrian hotel where the conference was being held . I booked 4 nights at the Intercontinental and was pleased with the elegance and convenient location ( an easy walk to the conference ) . From the lobby to the rooms , this hotel lives up to it 's storied reputation . ( The indoor pool seems to be imported from the set of a Busby Berkeley movie ! ) And even tho ' I was there for a conference , the hotel 's location on the Mag Mile and a quick jaunt to restaurants and theaters , made for a very pleasant stay at a very affordable price .
